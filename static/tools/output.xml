      <p>Always Dealing with Reality but Never Too Close to it: Original and Copy in Modern
        Aesthetics</p>

      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>The following essay deals with the idea that 1) the concept of copy is a most basic one in
        Western epistemology and still forming the ground of artistic and aesthetic notions up to
        today. Furthermore, the thesis that 2) the discourse of copy is always a discourse on the
        quality of reality of artistic and aesthetic works. Therefore, the notion of copy can give
        insights into the precarious but unavoidable relationship between art and the ideas of
        reality at its basis. While departing from a very contemporary point of view regarding this
        relationship and taking into consideration new techniques and theories, it can be
        demonstrated that the question of copy (and original) can be of help to
        overcome concepts of binarity as, for example, underlying the dichotomy of
        materiality-immateriality, material-form, thing-representation etc.—an approach
        dominating discourses throughout Modern aesthetics.</p>
      <p><bold>Keywords: </bold>Original, originality, reality, authenticity, facsimile</p>
      <p>Art and reality: Preliminary remarks</p>
      <p>The question concerning traits (or the quality and levels) of reality
        of an artistic object in relation to traits (or the quality and levels) of reality
        of empirical objects ranks among the most challenging questions in aesthetic theories,
        representing the hinge which connects—and, at the same time, highlights differences
        among—realism, idealism, phenomenology, constructivism, avant-gardism, and
          Modernism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e164"/> Hans Blumenberg suggests that aesthetic
        materiality can unfold in an aesthetic existence exemplary of one of many worlds, which thus
        reveals the structures of a “primordial essence of nature with new persuasive
        power” (Urgrundes der Natur in neuer
          Überzeugungskraft).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e176"/> However, Alain
        Robbe-Grillet’s realism is an alternative possibility. For Robbe-Grillet, the world is
        neither exemplary, nor meaningful, nor absurd. It simply “is.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e218"/> The material of a film, hence, remains limited and
        indefinitely repeatable: “It is a world without a past, a world which is
        self-sufficient at every moment and which obliterates itself as it proceeds. […] There
        can be no reality outside the images we see, the words we hear.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e227"/> Despite their historical proximity, Blumenberg’s und
        Robbe-Grillet’s assessments of aesthetic material could not differ more. The
        dissimilarity of their approaches shows that the position of verbal and pictorial arts can
        be determined according to how one answers questions pertaining to the quality of reality of
        the aesthetic as such. After all, the real, nature, and reality have been points of
        reference for images and texts since before the nineteenth century Realism.<sup> </sup>An
        interest in the semiotic relationship between empirical reality and the artistic
        medium—which also implies an interest in relations of perception and of
        portrayal—was already ingrained in the classical notion of mimesis, as well as having
        been pertinent to the invention of central perspective. The interest in this semiotic
        relationship has provided the basis for aesthetic theories of mimesis since the eighteenth
        century, as well as for genre- and media-theoretical discussions during the Enlightenment
        and Romanticism, to name but some points of reference. We are thus concerned with a question
        of aesthetic theory that has been of relevance until the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p>Original and copy are suitable metaphors for scrutinising—analytically and in a
        historicising manner—these relationships as an interplay of
        epistemological-ontological and immanently aesthetic issues. In the following, I will
        restrict myself to outlining this problem.</p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>The notion of the original</title>
      <p>In the context of modern aesthetic theory, the term “original” is highly
          ambivalent.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e350"/> On the one hand, it denotes a unique,
        evidently authentic object, attributed with so high an actual value of reality that it can
        also be regulated by a strict legal and economic framework. On the other hand, the original
        has to be constantly redefined as to its quality of reality: what determines the status of a
        fine-art photograph, a film, an installation, a performance, a painting from a fifteenth- or
        sixteenth-century workshop, or a multiple-times restored oil painting as
        “original?” Despite being frequently dealt with in economic and legal discourse,
        the idea of original and copy has an extensive impact onthe nature and function of all the
        levels and traits of reality within and outside of an art work. That this is not least due
        to the fact that the notion of original and copy is dependent on general concepts of reality
        shows the example of early modern aesthetics and its notion of original. The
        eighteenth-century concept of modern art as “originality/original” was specified
        by a metaphysical notion of nature, which for the artists and authors served as an
        “original” model. Yet, the artistic interpretation and representation of this
        model, the art works, engender new models of originality which, in turn, encourage
          <italic>imitatio</italic> by other works of art. This is a key to any understanding of
        classicism or idealism—that is to say, art for them always implies a copy. To sum up,
        art in general involves questions of traits of reality on various levels. Two of these will
        be dealt with in detail: </p>
      <p>a) The conceptual level, between art and general models of reality which unfold through
        different terminologies, conceptualisations, and modes of procedure; this is the field of
        the epistemological purpose of original and copy and </p>
      <p>b) The practical level of artistic and literary artefacts with their periodically changing
        modes.</p>
      <p>In said contexts, traits of reality for one thing play a part insofar as the relevance of a
        work as an original or a copy—which is informed by artistic programmes and aesthetic
        theories—strongly depends on the epistemologically marked metaphors of original and
        copy discussed under point a) above; and for another, traits of reality are of relevance in
        that they also channel attributions, rejections, or acceptance. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>The epistemological purpose of original and copy</title>
      <p>The postulate of mimesis (<italic>imitatio naturae</italic>) is
        certainly the most prominent concept of copying in Modernism. In the eighteenth and also in
        the nineteenth century, nature’s character in terms of originality was still
        undisputed and art was always (strictly speaking) nothing but a copy.
        The value of art resided in the influence it wielded on areas of cognition and action
        predetermined by nature. This postulate to imitate goes beyond specific aesthetic and
        artistic positions, as Friedrich Schiller shows in his description of
        “sentimentalischer Dichtung” and “naiver Dichtung”—sentimental
        as idealistically and naïve as realistically copying poetry—when both—their
        differences notwithstanding—are held up to copy human nature as such.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e669"/>Original, originality and copy bear a close relation to one
        another. All modern forms of realism and all media with strong representative and realistic
        features, such as photography or film, deal with this model of the copying original and
        artistic originality.</p>
      <p>Twentieth century modernism's attribution of an autonomous and constructive quality to art
        that exceeds a representative, referential, or realistic character obliterates (or at least
          renders precarious) the qualitative difference between original and copy, between a
        model and its representation. In that sense, despite their constructive characteristics, the
        arts’ quality of reality can be only gradually differentiated from that of empirical,
        non-artistic dimensions. In their most radical form, art’s quality of reality is
        identical to those of non-art. This is the aim, for instance, of “pure”
        modernist art; art that only knows “originals” when it comes to the relationship
        of art to reality, insofar as artistic originals are meant to engender ever-new, autonomous
        forms. Also in the context of the avant-gardes and their idea of the de-differentiation
        between art and reality—or rather between art and life—the opposition of
        original versus copy does not apply. Both modernism and avant-gardism only know originals.
        However, this approach has been consistently upended since the 1950s in the wake of new
        media, cultures, and notions of signs, images, and language. It appears more apt to speak of
        copies as lacking an original. Art plays with mediality, reproduction, and seriality (of which Pop Art
          and Photorealism may serve as examples). </p>
      <p>At the beginning of the twenty-first century, new challenges have to be confronted. This
        can be demonstrated by comparing the ground-breaking <italic>Documenta 5</italic> of 1972
        with the no less provoking <italic>Documenta 11</italic> of 2002.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e876"/> While the first dealt with the reality of ever-present mass media and
        its enormous production of overall images,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e900"/> the latter
        confronted globalization, postcoloniality, and the post 9/11 era with a strong artistic
        impact on documentary and realistic forms borrowed from non-artistic contexts. The curator
        Okwui Enwezor wanted to face the following problem:</p>
      <disp-quote>
        <p>In the past, institutional forms of exhibition practices à la Documenta were
          employed to devise a narrative context which was meant to either provide the backdrop for
          a homogenous understanding of art or to come to conclusions concerning the visual
          arts’ distinctive formal features which set them apart from all other practices.
          This was a vital aspect of understanding the institutional parameters of modern
          contemporary art. […] If there is one thing to be stated about Documenta 11’s
          spectacular quality of being different, it is this: The exhibition’s critical spaces
          have no aim to normalise or to make uniform all artistic visions on their way to
          institutional beatification.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e941"/>
        </p>
      </disp-quote>
      <p>The modes of institutionally, economically, and politically domesticated avant-gardes are
        meant to be replaced by postcoloniality’s model of opposition: “In
        postcoloniality we are constantly confronted with counter models used by those who are
        marginalised, that is those who are practically excluded from comprehensive global
        participation and who utilise counter models to shape new worlds by generating experimental
          cultures.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e950"/>
      </p>
      <p>On the occasion of <italic>Documenta 11</italic> (<xref rid="ID452e8d4b-9ff2-4ccf-b58f-d321bbce9160" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd7dba1cb-36af-41d7-87b3-13b7ec921e1a">2002</xref>) and its prevalence of documentary
        art, Boris Groys discusses the possible twenty-first-century relationships between and
        validity, respectively, of original and copy: in documentary art, a relationship between
        original and copy would indeed exist.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e991"/> The copy,
        however, is endowed with the value of an original in that it need not become a reflexive
        “work” but instead remains or becomes a thing or object which is dependent of
        narratives and medial modes. Documentary installations offer an example of this necessity to
        perceive the relationship between reality and art in terms of materiality and not of
        ontology. Like in bio-politics,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1033"/> the differentiation
        between original and copy—or between reality and construct—no longer
        characterises the differentiating metaphor of fiction (an ontological quality); rather it
        indicates a modal dissimilarity: “The documentation inscribes the existence of an
        object into history, endowing such an existence with a life span and thus, in turn, giving
        life as such to the object—regardless of whether said object “was originally
        animate or artificial.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1066"/> A precondition for this
        concept is a willingness to abandon the idea of a basic opposition between reality and
        art—which was still the case with <italic>Documenta 5</italic>—or between
        original and copy while at the same time accepting the differentiation as an everyday tool
        and to play with it. </p>
    </sec>
    <sec>
      <title>The practical level of original and copy</title>
      <p>The arts’ quality and traits of reality also determine intra-systemic relationships
        in the sense of relations between original and copy, which are situated within the specific
        context of production and reception. A notion that is essential for the aesthetic value of
        original and copy and which therefore helps to elucidate the relationship between a) and b)
        is authenticity. In the following, I will give a very short historical overview of the
        changeful history of original and copy in the context of authenticity. </p>
      <p>The meaning of the term “original,” in its earliest documented occurrences
          (in the
          twelfth century), was that of “not derivative” or “that [which]
        existed at first.” At the same time, it also means “archetype,” which
        presupposes the process of copying and denotes the notion of a model.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1185"/> In Latin, the term “authentic” was used synonymously, while
        an original (<italic>authenticum</italic>) was also an
        authenticated, certified document as well as an autograph, a manuscript. The term
        “original,” furthermore, refers to the model depicted in a painting—for
        instance, a real person or an object. As of the end of the seventeenth century, the term was
        occasionally used in the arts, while it became permanently established in the artistic
        context as of the end of the eighteenth century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1253"/> Thus
        the original is a constructed as well as an autonomous entity. Unsurprisingly, in the course
        of historical development, the terms “originality” and “original”
          (as an
          adjective), derived from the noun “original,” have additionally
        reinforced the elements of novelty, individuality, and ingenuity independent of a model.
        Here, the French language, where the term has been documented since the end of the
        seventeenth century, holds a pioneering position.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1316"/>
        Denis Diderot’s <italic>Encyclopédie </italic>states a connection between
          <italic>original</italic> and <italic>génie</italic>, which makes apparent the
        semantic field of the term original, spanning connected terms important for the arts such as
        “derived from nature,” “exemplary,” “new,” and
        “creative”: “It is used for things one copies. It is said that nature is
        my <italic>original</italic>; this drawing, this painting, despite being a copy, is my
          <italic>original</italic>. <italic>Original also </italic>denotes a drawing, a painting
        which a painter creates from imagination, from genius. Even when all of its parts are copied
        after nature.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1423"/>
      </p>
      <p>This combination of creativeness, uniqueness, and exemplariness makes the paradoxical
        relation of original to mimesis justifiable. This is the case in Immanuel Kant's famous
        dictum that “<italic>Genius</italic> is the talent (or natural gift) which
        gives the rule to Art. Since talent, as the innate productive faculty of the artist, belongs
        itself to Nature, we may express the matter thus: <italic>Genius</italic> is the innate
        mental disposition (<italic>ingenium</italic>) <italic>through
          which</italic> Nature gives the rule to Art.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1475"/>
      </p>
      <p>Despite its quality of copy, art then becomes unique in the sense of being matchless and
        inimitable. Or, as Umberto Eco puts it, art is its own original.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1486"/> In that sense, the original work of art has to be validated multiple
        times. Hence the act of authentication is divided among several authorities: the
        author/artist, the connoisseur, art history, the art market, the media, and scholarship.
        However, it was only toward the end of the nineteenth century that a stricter opposition
        between original and copy developed; namely when the postulate of imitation (of both nature
          and artistic models) was abandoned, the autonomous, creative artist gained complete
        acceptance—also in the legal and economic field—and new technical means of
        reproducing artefacts (such as photography) had been invented.
        As long as the notion of imitation justifies art, original and copy are not mutually
        exclusive. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries still distinguished between a bad copy
        and a good copy, between the mere reproduction of a model and an imitation which came close
        to the ideal. At the same time, the nineteenth century is considered—and often also
        considered itself to be—an age of copy and reproduction. Despite all criticism
        levelled against technological innovations and their application in the arts, photography,
        for example, caused the enthusiastic incorporation of reproduced images into everyday life.
        In the face of these developments in the media-related context, original and copy needed to
        be re-discussed.</p>
      <p>Therefore, twentieth century aesthetic theories were in need of a category for
        legitimation, which could be found in authenticity: On the one hand the term denoted a trait
        of reality which depended on the work’s status of original or copy and which was
        legitimised through various instances of authentication/certification like the law, science,
        or expert opinion. On the other hand, authenticity expressed a reality and validity peculiar
        to art. Clement Greenberg, the theoretician of American Modernism, for instance, locates the
        peculiar authenticity of art in its peculiar historicity: “Nothing could be further
        from the authentic art of our time than the idea of a rupture of continuity. Art
          <italic>is</italic>—among other things—continuity, and unthinkable without it.
        Lacking the past of art, and the need and compulsion to maintain its standards of
        excellence, Modernist art would lack both substance and justification.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1654"/> This concept can be termed
          <italic>Kunstauthentizität</italic> (art-informed authenticity).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1672"/> The latter is based on the idea of a creative, autonomous
        subject and does not face opposition, even in Andy Warhol's artistic coup, which is to
        employ the copy as a provocation in the face of the differentiation between art and non-art,
        in that it excludes neither subjective artistic nor conceptual authenticity. The concept of
        authenticity retains its validity even when craftsmanship and creativity no longer
        constitute any basis for art.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1702"/> In spite of the
        delegation of manufacturing work from the artist to professionals and industry (Jeff Koons,
        for example, has an enormous workshop hall with numerous assistants in New York), the demand
        for the work and the artist to be unique and original is upheld. A group of Minimalist
        artists who worked with industrial materials rejected the replication of their works, which
        were collected for an exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum at the beginning of the 1990s,
        with the following argument: neither the objects themselves nor the plans were sufficient to
        create replicas equal in value to the originals because circumstances can unexpectedly
        change the appearance of a piece during production. Therefore the materiality of the
        individual work has significance and the necessary authenticity is only attributed by the
          artist.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1751"/>
      </p>
      <p>This authority of the artist can be supplemented by the contextual authenticity of the
        convention, the attribution whereby a work is made into a work of art. Arthur C. Danto
        confronted the dilemma of art criticism in the face of an art that is no longer determined
        by external characteristics such as technical accomplishment, material, and objects, and
        internal characteristics such as genre and style, in response to Andy Warhol's exhibition of
        the <italic>Brillo Box</italic>, in 1964.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1770"/> Given the
        perceptually indistinguishable difference between art and everyday objects, the philosopher
        is confronted with a previously neglected philosophical question about art, namely, what is
        it that constitutes art and how are completely identical objects to be distinguished in
        terms of art and non-art? This question stands in the same problematic context as questions
        about falsification and the original: to design a Brillo box means nothing for the art
        market (although the designer was an artist who accepted the contract due to financial
        exigency), but to exhibit one may impart lasting renown.</p>
      <p>This dissolution of classifications is further radicalised in multi-media performances of
        situations and actions, as in Daniel Spoerri's eating-actions, for which galleries are
        turned into restaurants. The work is a series of specific events, an “excerpt from a
        situation of direct day-to-day living,”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1821"/>that is
        neither original nor copy, nor is it falsifiable.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1828"/> Art
        is actionist in all kinds of ways, a search for traces in everyday life, playing out
        patterns of actions, and performing and documenting everyday situations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1842"/> The extent to which the art expert too can cling to the longstanding
        division between original and copy is demonstrated by Francis V. O’Connor: </p>

        <p>It used to be that an “original” work of art was understood to have been
          created by the artist, its originality proved with documents, signatures, and the informed
          opinion of experts. […] More recently, there has been a disturbing tendency to
          denigrate the authority of both artist and expert, to confuse truth with dogma, and to
          treat all created objects as “texts” which can be used as pretexts for new
          texts based on the free associations of their relativistic authors. […] Taken to
          extremes, such a point of view denies the objectivity of historical truth, and would deem
          a fake to be as culturally significant as an authentic object.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1890"/>

      <title>The original in the digital age, or, the perfect copy: Paolo Veronese and Adam
        Lowe’s Le nozze di Cana (1562–63 and 2007)</title>
      <p>As a contemporary example for a further stage of the original-to-copy relation, I would
        like to examine the digitally-produced facsimile of Paolo Veronese’s large painting,
          <italic>Le nozze di Cana</italic>,and the discussion concerned with it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1924"/>
      </p>
      <p>Veronese’s original painting, executed between 1562 and 1563, has been exhibited at
        the Louvre since 1798, when it was brought to Paris by Napoleon as war loot. It was
        originally kept in the refectory of Isola San Giorgio Maggiore, a building designed by
        Palladio, where it was exhibited in such a perfect manner that it soon became famous and was
        frequently visited. Over the centuries, various attempts to return it to Italy were
          undertaken.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1959"/> On September 11, 2007—exactly 210
        years after the Veronese painting had been removed—a facsimile was installed in San
        Giorgio Maggiore’s refectory, which since Palladio had also undergone extensive
        reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">fig. 1</xref>). </p>     
      <p>The facsimile created by Adam Lowe is a technically elaborate piece, which takes into
        account the conditions from which Veronese’s painting originated, as well as
        Palladio’s spatial construction, that is the conditions of light and materials.
        Lowe’s piece, executed in the artist’s Madrid studio <italic>Faktum Arte,
        </italic>has not only made it possible to re-stage a historical situation, it also allows
        for the animation of the painting’s particular history, in which we find united a
        congenial artistic cooperation between architect and painter, combined with political
        rivalry (Napoleon and Venice) and matters of loss and restitution. Bruno Latour focused on
        this complex situation in the essay “The Migration of the Aura.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2047"/> With Lowe, Latour elaborates on the modifications
        determined by digital media and comes to the conclusion that attributing, as well as
        differentiating between, the status of original and copy ultimately depends on the given
        technical means and situation. This is because those factors determine an artwork’s
        history, which is always one of reproduction and reworking. To describe this process, Latour
        uses the term “trajectory,” that is, the line/abstraction which permits tracing
        a sequence of events, changes, etc. in the history of a piece—in short, a biography of
        the work. It is such a line that the “perfect copy” of Veronese’s painting
        exhibited in Venice supposedly draws. The fact that it is a highly accurate reproduction,
        which considers both matters of colour and of three-dimensionality, is merely one aspect of
        its overall success. In Latour’s and Lowe’s view, there is a version
          <italic>n</italic> of artistic and literary artefacts, which is succeeded by respective
        versions <italic>n1</italic>, <italic>n2</italic>, etc. However, the configurations in which
        the latter appear, as well as the consequences they have upon the original, depend upon the
        given technical situation and conditions, and on how those are dealt with. The conceptual
        authenticity of an image is thus a quality that cannot be diminished in terms of its
        distinctiveness when art works are being copied, transformed, or even when they reproduce
        everyday objects. This is, for instance, the case when Rubens considers black-and-white
        drawings or engravings of paintings legitimate media to enable the beholder to understand
        the image, when Diderot in his Encyclopédie distinguishes between the copy of an
        original as original and the copy of a copy as copy, or when Arthur C. Danto declares Andy
        Warhol’s <italic>Brillo Box</italic> to be “art,” due to its unconditional
        conceptuality. </p>
      <p>In its turn, digital technology is able to play with, simulate, and produce all kinds of
        medial formats For Latour, dividing the arts into repeatable and unique forms or
          classes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2181"/> becomes obsolete in light of the dissolution
        of analogue image semiotics caused by digital technology. Like a play or a musical score, an
        image becomes “stageable” and repeatable, and can, time and again, be newly
        fashioned in its originality, provided the respective copies are of high quality, capable of
        changing, and offer ever new approaches to the (immaterial) quality of originality. The
        aesthetic interrelatedness of materiality and immateriality thus appears as a variable and
        non-hierarchised form. Lowe’s image becomes as much Veronese’s image as
        Veronese’s image becomes Lowe’s image. Original and copy are mutually dependant
        in a constructive way via modal formations (narration, technology/technique, installation,
        interpretation, etc.). Latour’s conclusion concerning a good copy is that it extends
        the original in terms of its originality. A good copy “adds originality to the
        original version by offering it new dimensions without jeopardizing the penultimate
        version—without ever touching it, thanks to the delicate process used to record
          it.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2262"/>
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this very aspect of the trajectory is in need of specification. The notion of
        originality disregards the question as to where and how aesthetic conceptuality (immateriality) arises—or should arise—and as to how it can and should
        be receptively experienced. The concept of originality privileged by Latour does not embrace
        the operating modes of newer and most recent arts. For this a short resume of original and
        copy in their respective relation to authenticity.</p>

      <title>Conclusion: authenticity, original, and copy</title>
      <p>The relationship between the arts and reality, which has been defined as a relationship
        between original and copy since the age of Humanism and the
        Renaissance, is determined by epistemological-ontological and intra-systemic relations. In
        mediaeval art and literature, by contrast, it marks a dilemma in need of constant
        processing, as it touches upon questions concerning the possibilities and the legitimisation
        of human production, on the significance of authors versus a divine creator, and of creative
        form versus hierarchically-structured and analogously related <italic>res</italic> and
          <italic>individuum</italic>. By harkening back to classical models, the Renaissance
        employs mimesis—the creative production of a likeness (copy) from a model
          (original)—as the basis for the development of the modern era’s notion
        of art. Since the nineteenth century, the relational complex of original and copy within the
        mentioned epistemological-ontological and intra-systemic premises of the modern era has
        formed the background for the arts while developing the idea of a strictly differentiated
        relationship between original and copy, a wish that develops alongside the possibility of
        creating exact reproductions, the emergence of an elaborate art market, and its related
        legal framework. Since the advent of the avant-garde, and even more so since the 1950s, the
        arts have increasingly abandoned strictly binary structures and—to the confusion of
        audience and critics alike—there no longer appears to be a preference. Adam Lowe
        writes on this matter: “In a world of genetic modification notions of originality may
        not be as obvious as they once seemed. It is becoming clear that originality does not exist
        in a quasi-religious notion of ‘aura’ but it lies in more physical things. It
        lies in the intrinsic qualities of an object. It is not fixed and it can be bestowed and
          removed.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2387"/> Like “aura,”
          “originality” has become a historical term. “Authenticity” is
        certainly a term which, more aptly than “original,” subsumes the arts’
        physical and intrinsic traits of reality as mentioned by Lowe.</p>
      <p>Contrary to originality, the notion of authenticity is more comprehensive in operational
        terms. Like originality, authenticity basically displays a paradoxical structure situated
        between self-validation and validation through others, between autological and
        hetereological significance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2443"/> However, other than
        originality, authenticity encompasses normative, evaluative, interpretative, and descriptive
        modes of application. Moreover, the term is gradable, extendable by attributes, and makes it
        possible to describe poetics and approaches beyond traditional notions of art; yet, the term
        primarily refers to the various constellations of empirical and conceptual conditionality of
        art and literature. What is respectively at stake are sources of certification such as
        author, witness, media, law, and economy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2456"/> Objects are
        authentic when they are authenticated by a legitimising source or authority. Subjects are
        authentic when they are authenticated either as their own authors or creators or through
        objects, media, and works. Authenticity is shaped by a complex of individual perspectives
        and objectifying authentication.</p>
      <p>This ongoing processuality between various categories of certification and validity, of
        mise-en-scène and notions of truth-determining concepts of authenticity, illustrates
        that both general and individual moments as well as performative and empirical moments are
        inherent to the notion of authenticity. Combined, these moments form a complex which, in
        turn, can fulfil legitimising, interpretative, explanatory, referential, and representative
        functions. Therein lies the attraction of authenticity in modernity: the authentic is the
        outcome of a time- and place-specific process of certification that has to be continually
        reestablished. In their complex facets, copy versus original is but one example of the
        relevance of authenticity to the modern era, and especially as a term used for defining the
        relationship between art and reality. </p>

          bio-politics is embedded in the present discussions about aritificial live, artificial
          creation, and the artificial maintainance of life (Foucault 1997, 73–79). </p>

        <p> Danto 1981. Arthur C. Danto takes the most important innovations in art since Duchamps
          Ready-Mades, Pop Art, Conceptual Art and Minimal Art as the starting point of his inquiry.
          He therefore neither presumes a creative genius nor a closed character of the work of art
            (<italic>geschlossenen Werkcharakter</italic>) that demands originality. At a time when
          the copy/reproduction of everyday items and the use of industrially produced material
          admit of art, for Danto the artistic character of works can no longer lie in the
          perceptual, but rather only in the conceptual (Danto 1981, 44). Cf. Knaller 2012,

          forgery of it is significant; or better, if and only if even the most exact duplication of
          it does not thereby count as genuine,” Goodman 1976, 113. On the contrary to this
          allographic arts like music, dance, theater, or literature allow for or even imply
          repetition. </p>
