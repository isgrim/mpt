      <title>Acknowledgements</title>
      <p>There are many people I would like to thank for supporting my research on expatriate youths and for helping me to write this book. I want to acknowledge the academic and financial support of the Cluster of Excellence “Asia and Europe in a Global Context: Shifting Asymmetries in Cultural Flows” at Heidelberg University, Germany, that helped me transform a dissertation idea into an academic endeavor. I am grateful for the debates I have had with many of the Cluster’s members and the advice and critiques they gave me throughout the years. I especially want to thank my two advisors, Christiane Brosius and Barbara Mittler, for their guidance. I also want to thank all those who encouraged me to rework my dissertation into this book: the anonymous reviewer whose valuable comments helped to sharpen my arguments, and particularly Andrea Hacker, who guided me through the rewriting process. Thanks also go to Andrea’s team, especially to Elizabeth Corrao, for her thorough language editing.</p>
      
      
          <p> I could not have finished this book without my family—especially my wonderful parents, Traudel and Henning Sander, my partner Benjamin, and my friends—“my girls”—Annika, Franziska, and Tanja. To my friend in Shanghai, Yanni Shen, who never tired of explaining and translating, thank you. </p>
        
      
      
      
          <p> I am very grateful for the crucial support of school principals and teachers who were interested in my research. The largest debt of all, however, is owed to all the students in Shanghai who, along with their families, shared their stories and time with me, and especially to those whose words, ideas, and actions appear in this ethnography and made it what I wanted it to be: a book that focuses on the voices and perspectives of the teenagers themselves. Thank you for letting me into your lives despite my having an agenda and for patiently waiting for the outcome of our joint endeavor.</p>

                </title>
              
                <p> It is Saturday afternoon and seventeen-year-old Paul is sitting opposite me at a
                    café on Wulumuqi Road in downtown Shanghai. Below our window, buses, taxis,
                    honking electric scooters, and pedestrians carrying umbrellas to shield off the
                    sun pass by until they disappear into the narrow, sycamore-tree-lined streets of
                    the former French concession. Inside, the air conditioning is humming and music
                    is playing in the background, while Paul, who has been introduced to me as an
                    “American student” by our common acquaintance Matthias, shares his
                    story of growing up on the move. Paul is a German national, born in Brazil to a
                    Brazilian mother and a German father. He grew up in Brazil and the United States
                    and moved to Shanghai six years prior to the interview. Here, he is enrolled in
                    one of Shanghai’s American schools. Learning that his father is German,
                    like me, I wonder if we should switch to my native language for the interview.
                    Noticing my general difficulty comprehending the many moves, places, tongues,
                    and people that he references, Paul helps by clarifying his language skills:</p>

                        <p>And China. And Brazil. But I speak very little German. I can
                            understand it. Okay. But I can‘t speak it really. I can say like:
                            hello, thank you, please. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e58">1</xref>

                    </speech>
                </p>
                <p>As I listen to his account of the many moves and languages to which he has
                    already been exposed at his young age, I begin to understand that Paul can
                    hardly be sufficiently represented by the label “American student”
                    that I had assigned to him before our encounter. His experiences include growing
                    up on the move in a bi-national family. His and his parents’
                    nationalities, languages, and cultural practices differ both from those of his
                    school and from his country of residence. Until recently, he never lived in
                    Germany, the country that issued his passport, nor does he speak the language
                    that it is written in. He has limited Chinese language skills and few contacts
                    to locals of his age because activities and friendships outside of Jinqiao,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e66255">2</xref> or the expatriate “bubble”
                    as he calls it, are rare.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e73">3</xref> His
                    description of this “bubble” is reminiscent of the accounts by
                    mobile professionals’ transnational practices summarized by cultural and
                    urban geographer David Ley:</p>

                    <disp-quote id="dispquote1">
                        <p>Foreshortened time and space create a circumscribed lifeworld around
                            work, bars, and sporting and expatriate clubs. [...] The outcome is a
                            lifeworld that is the opposite of the expansive and inclusive networks
                            implied by ungrounded or deterritorialized networks. Instead, the social
                            geography of the transnational elite may be highly localized, restricted
                            to particular territories. As they are dispatched internationally from
                            city to city, the transnational capitalist class are island hopping from
                            one expatriate enclave to another (<xref rid="IDdd559141-943d-45ed-a785-de7127b8eb7a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID99b84c62-546d-4c4f-95db-68089ed0f10d">Ley 2004, 157</xref>).
                        </p>
                    </disp-quote>
                </p>

                <p>Paul seems to have mastered this art of “island hopping,” of finding
                    a place in expatriate communities as a way of coping with growing up
                    transnationally. He is not alone. As my own descriptions of the spatial
                    practices of expatriate youths will demonstrate, this “island
                    hopping” that Ley describes is a very location-based practice involving
                    very concrete sites. </p>
                <p>Paul’s experience of mobility, shifting borders, and differences is one of
                    the most extreme among the expatriate youths I encountered. His situation of
                    living in China, being born in Brazil and speaking Portuguese at home, having
                    lived and been educated in the United States, yet being German according to his
                    passport are hard to grasp for me during our first encounter. Paul seems
                    unsurprised by my confusion and by being labeled differently depending on his
                    place of birth, country of upbringing, or passport. When we talk about his
                    private, Christian, American school in Shanghai, for instance, he mentions that,
                    including himself, only two Europeans are currently enrolled. Just hearing him
                    label himself “European” in a perfect American accent, when he has
                    never even lived in Europe, is surprising. Paul’s particularly flexible
                    way of positioning himself in terms of national or cultural identity clearly
                    depends on his point of reference (schooling, passport, family ties) and seems
                    to respond to different labels others appoint to him. </p>
                <p>How do young people like Paul deal with a frequently changing environment and how
                    do they manage such varied and shifting sources of cultural identity? This
                    ethnographic study addresses this question by exploring the everyday lives of
                    expatriate youths in general and Paul’s and his peers’ own
                    perspectives in particular. I am interested in foreign students’
                    experiences of living abroad in Shanghai, their age-specific views on growing up
                    on the move, and their notions of “home.” Their stories raise
                    important questions about our understanding of national or cultural identity and
                    ways of belonging. Their experiences illustrate that common notions of either
                    are often too limited to capture the cultural complexities in the lives of
                    youths who have spent most of their childhood outside the country that issued
                    their passports. Some of them, like Paul, were born into a bi-national marriage
                    and, while living abroad, might wonder which of their parents’ cultural
                    frameworks seems most applicable, or has had the most influence on them. Others
                    attend an international school that teaches in a language other than the one
                    they speak at home or in the streets, which requires a significant linguistic
                    flexibility. Still others have parents who have migrant backgrounds themselves.
                    Their children’s stories show that it is too simple to assume that, for
                    instance, a child born to Chinese parents in France, who is
                    “returning” to China and attending a French school, could simply
                    feel “Chinese.” Furthermore, someone who is fifteen and has moved
                    five times across national borders might question if a current place of
                    residence can actually still provide some form of belonging or cultural
                    identity. </p>
                <p>These scenarios show that Paul and his peers are, despite their youth, experts on
                    the effects and challenges of migration. By studying their stories and everyday
                    practices, I want to understand which competencies and strategies are important
                    for young people moving globally. In short, this ethnography traces what it
                    means to pass through Shanghai—to move to the city and leave it again
                    within a few years—and to actively cope with the experiences that go along
                    with it.</p>
                <p>Increasingly, expatriate communities and international schools around the globe
                    answer Paul’s and his peers’ questions about the effects of moving
                    and negotiating cultural identity by referring to Pollock and Van Reken’s
                    ( <xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2969ca83-55a0-4ef2-98cf-fbe613a6cfe3">[1999] 2009</xref> ) concept of
                    “Third Culture Kids.” The concept addresses one aspect of expatriate
                    lives that my fieldwork and in-depth interviews with expatriate youths will also
                    reveal: despite all its privileges and opportunities, growing up “on the
                    move” and/or in a transient space demands that these children constantly
                    cope with changes, loss, and questions of belonging and identity. </p>

                <p>Well-received and popular among—at least Anglophone—expatriate
                    circles today, the concept of “Third Culture Kids” (TCKs) was
                    originally introduced by John Useem and Ruth Hill Useem in the 1950s (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8014e67f-9fb0-4fe2-af45-005aec388375">see Pollock and Van Reken [1999]

                    researchers described the parents’ home culture as the first culture and
                    the culture of the place of residence as the second culture. “The
                    ‘Third Culture’ to them was the culture of the expatriate community,
                    which they understood as a ‘culture between cultures’ integrating
                    cultural features of home and host societies” (<xref rid="ID1193b8a0-bf93-4cb7-864b-b11504abd3d1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID10df8fca-1201-4fbc-b4a3-8f43cfdeb2cb">Knörr 2005, 53</xref>).
                    Later, Ruth Van Reken and David Pollock’s (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDce4226aa-1ea8-4930-8f5a-6ccd726838a7">[1999] 2009</xref>) book Third
                    Culture Kids: Growing Up Among Worlds helped the concept gain immense
                    popularity. Their work sets out to be a self-help book for members of expatriate
                    communities and their ideas have been developed further in various (parental)

                <p>The findings of these studies, guidebooks, magazines, and websites (with a focus
                    on Western children) discuss how a life outside the parents’ home country
                    and particularly a lifestyle of constant moving affects children. TCKs are
                    represented as a group sharing many qualities, despite growing up in different
                    countries. Pollock and Van Reken ( <xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7fc642bd-af52-4b7d-b7ab-386c485d9480">[1999] 2009, 39</xref>) argue
                    that “for TCKs the moving back and forth from one culture to another
                    happens before they have completed the critical developmental task of forming a
                    sense of their own personal or cultural identity.” This quote reveals the

                    it, “absurd notion of an uncontaminated culture in a single
                    country,” that seems to occasionally underlie the reasoning behind the TCK
                    concept. Based on such a notion of culture, Pollock and Van Reken see how the
                    children’s upbringing results in “the paradoxical nature of the TCK
                    experience—the sense of being profoundly connected yet simultaneously
                    disconnected with people and places around the world” (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb9caabee-b862-4261-bc50-c789646d7faf">Pollock and Van Reken [1999]

                    are presented as central for TCKs. These problems, Pollock and Van Reken argue,
                    are due to “an interplay of these factors—living in both a
                    culturally changing and highly mobile world during the formative years”

                    Concerning the relational patterns, the frequent experience of goodbyes,
                    according to Pollock and Van Reken, can sometimes lead to “patterns of
                    protecting themselves” (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID473af686-9981-42b7-b332-711e4a1a2075">ibid.,
                        131</xref>) and struggles with a “fear of intimacy because of the fear

                        139</xref>). But the authors also describe how TCKs “will go to
                    greater lengths than some people might consider normal to nurture relational
                    ties with others” (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDac8ed2f8-9216-4598-bc68-30c533e5fbca">ibid.,
                        131</xref>). TCKs, according to them, place a high value on their
                    relationships and often jump into “deeper levels of relationship”
                        (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9a4681e3-5820-46be-abd1-3a5ea8b8f581">ibid., 136</xref>). Unresolved
                    grief is another issue that Pollock and Van Reken address, an issue that is
                    related to losses expatriate children experience by moving. However, these
                    losses are often hidden and unrecognized for a variety of reasons. The authors
                    also attest that an “uneven maturity” troubles TCKs. Although their
                    experience with TCKs often lead adults to view them as extremely mature—a
                    maturity and comfort level with adults that most TCKs also perceive in
                    themselves (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a9381e9-f7ee-44a8-bf05-126ab3e589e5">ibid., 151</xref>), according to
                    Pollock and Van Reken—few spaces are available for TCKs “to test
                    rules during their teenage years” (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID09b596b6-90a1-47cf-a8ff-2bce91425113">ibid., 152</xref>). TCKs are
                    therefore often unsure of which norms to rebel against. This uncertainty can
                    lead to a postponed rebellion that usually manifests itself later, in college.
                    The benefits of TCK life, including the expanded worldview and the
                    well-developed skills mentioned above, are linked to the experience of
                    differences and having to learn how to deal with them through observation and
                    adaptation. </p>
                <p>Although it appeared in 1999, Pollock and Van Reken’s book is based on
                    surveys that were conducted in the early and mid-1980s with adults aged
                    twenty-two to twenty-seven, who were asked to reflect upon their childhood and
                    the impact that moving had on their lives. These “kids,” in other
                    words, were mainly born in the 1960s. Processes of globalization and the spread
                    and gaining influence of media and communication technologies have surely led to
                    changes in the experience of growing up abroad since then. More current results,
                    based on an online survey,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e122">4</xref> are
                    offered in the self-help book Expat Teens Talk (<xref rid="IDfc584da8-c975-4044-98a0-47b3e009bc9e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID080e7ced-6310-40b3-a90d-4c2405d508a7">Pittman and Smit 2012</xref>).
                    The book collects answers from parents, counselors, and other TCKs to questions
                    the authors received from expat teens. Consequently, their approach only
                    presents advice with very limited insight into expatriate youths’ daily
                    practices and social worlds. </p>
                <p>Such everyday experiences, however, explain how children and teenagers cope with
                    moving, and how they create world-views and ways of belonging within certain
                    communities, cultural environments, or nations. Paul, for instance, excitedly
                    talks about having met our common acquaintance Matthias during various nightlife
                    activities and how he eventually started hanging out with him. They became
                    friends, played music together, and founded a band which, however, no longer
                    exists, due to difficulties they had arranging practice sessions (the students
                    live one and a half hours apart by car or metro). It becomes clear, though, that
                    nightlife practices, hobbies, and friendships significantly impact Paul’s
                    and his fellow expatriate teenagers’ Shanghai experiences. </p>

                    necessity for further theoretical conceptualizations of expatriates, calling for
                    an integration and inclusion of studies on mobile professionals into mainstream
                    migration studies. They propose linking the subject theoretically with
                    postcolonial theory, consequently integrating both topics. Integrating research
                    on expatriates into migration studies, so the argument goes, is necessary to
                    contest limited notions of migration processes and images of migrants. Although
                    many of these qualitative research projects take ethnic, racial, and
                    particularly gendered experiences of privileged migration into account, most
                    neglect the age-specific experiences of children and adolescents. With the

                    within the community and offer to help expatriate youths facing problems of
                    belonging and identity by establishing a feeling of community. Based on these
                    publications, the concept of TCK was also used and promoted in Shanghai’s
                    expatriate community centers and by school counselors. The author Ruth Van Reken
                    had even given a talk at Paul’s school. It is this reinforcement of the
                    sense of belonging to a special TCK, Global Nomad, or expat community that the
                    guidebooks and the talks in Shanghai promote that raised my awareness of
                    something I call “TCK nationalism.” This “TCK
                    nationalism” offers a simplified form of belonging for what is otherwise a
                    complex phenomenon and attracts individuals through its rhetoric, clear
                    definitions of insiders and outsiders, and feelings of superiority.</p>
                <p>Talking to Paul and other students, I find it difficult to see their flexible and
                    reflexive ways of negotiating identity as claiming clear belonging “in
                    relationship to others of similar background” (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID865bfc54-4de2-4d3f-8273-aa9d9a10736b">see Pollock and Van Reken [1999]
                        2009, 19</xref>). In other words, as simply being a TCK. During our first
                    encounter, Paul seems to make very few claims of belonging at all. Home is a
                    rather vague idea to him which he reluctantly refers to as “wherever I am
                    staying.” When he describes his multi-local experiences, it is almost a
                    non-attachment to places and people that comes to the fore. This adjustable idea
                    of home also relates to his particularly flexible and ever-shifting way of
                    positioning himself in terms of cultural identity depending on the point of
                    reference. I argue that it is therefore clearly necessary to complicate and
                    critically reinvestigate the TCK issue outside of the guidebook phenomenon to
                    further understand Paul’s and other expatriate youths’ ways of
                    situating and comprehending themselves in a world that is in constant flux.</p>

                    International school culture, she claims, is often westernized. For students
                    with Asian backgrounds “cultural dissonance” may arise between
                    “‘Western’ culture by day and ‘Asian’ culture by

                    that, in describing feelings of “cultural dissonance,” previous
                    analyses of TCKs only address repatriation or “life after the expatriate
                    microcosm”—life after the “bubble,” as student Paul
                    phrased it. Observing these feelings (and, I would add, the need to creatively
                    cope with the different cultural worlds at home and at school), Tanu witnesses
                    “similar, though not identical” experiences of “Asian”
                    TCKs and those “of second generation immigrants growing up in Western

                    Pollock and Van Reken have broadened the definition of the term to include
                    “all children who move into another society with their parents,”
                    thus making TCK too wide a term that no longer allows for distinguishing between
                    “a Sierra Leonean refugee in the United States and an American son of an
                    ambassador somewhere in Africa.” Knörr, an anthropologist, takes a
                    long overdue critical stance against the TCK concept and rightly points out that
                    this broadening of the concept covers up ideologies connected with the TCK
                    approach and remains associated primarily with “Western children brought
                    up in the so-called Third World” and not to immigrant children in Europe

                    the concept of TCK as an ideology that implicitly reinforces qualifying

                <p>Knörr succinctly points out the differences in everyday life, as well as in
                    academic discourse, when it comes to the discussion of issues of cultural
                    practices or cultural identities among privileged migrants—expatriate
                    youths—and migrants coming to Western countries—immigrant youths.
                    Whereas the “cultural background” of migrant youths in Germany, for
                    example, is seen to cause problems, expatriate youths—TCKs—are
                    associated with cultural creativity. While I acknowledge the “appropriate
                    cultural creativity” of the TCK concept and how it might help expatriate
                    youths to realize that they are not the only ones with such
                    experiences—especially after a move “back home”—I
                    nevertheless agree with Knörr’s position.</p>
                <p>One way to save this well-meaning concept of TCKs, which acknowledges creativity
                    and offers support through creating a like-minded community from its
                    “ideology of difference,” is a radical extension of its use: the
                    term TCK does not need to be reserved for qualifying Western expatriates alone.
                    If the label were broadened to include all migrant youths, it could help
                    acknowledge the full range of their creative practices and their universal
                    potential to create "Third Cultures.” When capturing immigrant
                    youths’ experiences in Europe or the USA for instance, I suggest linking
                    the TCK concept to approaches in postcolonial studies, such as Homi
                    Bhabha’s (<xref rid="ID3986bf97-261b-4171-8f3a-ebb873d89b81" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc215b887-063e-48f9-929e-89d232095816">[1994]
                        2009</xref>) metaphor of the “Third Space” that describes a
                    chaotic meeting space, “the cutting edge of translation and negotiation,
                    the inbetween space” (<xref rid="ID3986bf97-261b-4171-8f3a-ebb873d89b81" ref-type="bibr" id="ID016389e2-3997-46ea-af5f-d3198bc72fc0">ibid.,
                    56</xref>), where migrants discuss and create multiple new meanings and cultural
                    affiliations. The TCK idea can help simplify or ground the cultural creativity
                    that lies in such concepts as Bhabha’s. However, as my own empirical focus
                    on privileged migration is too specific to meaningfully contribute to such a
                    broadening, and as the concept, in my view, still contains ideologies of
                    difference in its usage, I refrain from using it in this study.</p>
                <p>This rejection of the TCK concept does not mean that the—mostly
                    implicit—ideologies of difference will remain hidden; on the contrary,
                    depending on social status and origin, such differences clearly affect the
                    migration experience. “Global migration is far easier for highly-skilled
                    workers and those with capital than it is for those without training or
                    resources,” writes geographer Doreen Massey (<xref rid="ID54e9bf6e-d5bd-442b-b2e1-10ec2231e331" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1462736e-68d8-4cda-b181-0836acff5c7e">1995, 197</xref>). But there are
                    other terms more suitable to describe the phenomenon at hand. For instance, the
                    term “privileged migrant” immediately addresses the inequalities
                    that TCK obscures. By following the TCK concept I would a priori accept the
                    children and youth under discussion as having “relationships to all of the
                    cultures, while not having full ownership in any” (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdeaf45ec-526a-4e0a-b91a-3b7034ec5465">Pollock and Van Reken [1999]

                    TCKs as previous research has repeatedly done (<xref rid="ID3e454a5a-f6d4-4297-8f87-270f9888125d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5d9147be-2f94-4f94-a9b1-2ed39c1ea95f">Franke 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ID3d4d34ae-44e8-481f-914d-352e2837f5ff" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1a351ba5-1150-4316-9c64-4dccf46fba28">Richter 2011</xref>), it is
                    important to look at practices of expatriate youth more
                    generally—including everyday practices and identity performances that
                    contradict such a definition. All these studies based on the a priori TCK
                    definition only investigate youth (or mostly adults’ reflections on their
                    youth) that fit into the category, therefore automatically finding
                    “homogeneity within heterogeneity” (<xref rid="ID8e22dcca-c788-4a44-8e75-1a2789cb6973" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa46054f8-395d-4b10-9da8-91a1ec2b3c88">Griese 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ID3d4d34ae-44e8-481f-914d-352e2837f5ff" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf4ec8d8a-de8d-4876-b762-432d6873d034">quoted in Richter 2011,

                    think that these adult retrospectives may often be linked to established
                    narratives that attempt to make sense of the experience. I therefore follow an
                    ethnographic practice that further distinguishes my study in Shanghai from
                    former research focusing on TCKs. Instead of inquiring into adult
                    retrospectives, I spent time among youths to understand their own points of view

                    about defining “adolescence,” be it biologically based, “as
                    the period encompassing the onset of puberty and going until individuals are
                    capable of sexual reproduction,” or sociologically, as “the period

                    social development and influenced by anthropological studies, a more prominent
                    discussion emerged that addressed diversity and, consequently, “the

                <p>The societal context of development has always been the focus of studies
                    investigating youths’ cultural practices. These approaches can mostly be
                    traced back to the early to mid-twentieth century American sociological
                    tradition of the Chicago School and the British tradition of the Centre for
                    Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS), which opened in 1964 in Birmingham. US
                    sociologists focused on attempts to explain deviant activities. Interested in
                    crime, drug consumption, and gang membership, they looked for collective
                    normative behavior and moral codes specific to the groups studied (<xref rid="IDd537b499-32d8-4404-84e0-3207176c42ce" ref-type="bibr" id="ID77e609f7-a671-479c-a9e0-97050287cfb1">Hodkinson 2007, 3</xref>; <xref rid="ID891c23ec-aa76-47dc-b5be-dc26aa783c78" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbbebc9d5-050c-4102-b13f-f42206c238eb">Bucholtz 2002, 536</xref>).
                    These scholars regarded youth as a difficult liminal phase and delinquent youths
                    as victims and products of a deprived urban environment (<xref rid="ID1ae84f07-de3b-48ff-b321-3576b763c788" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb350b1f1-6bc9-44f2-9d74-ad24da94840e">Moser 2000, 17</xref>). While
                    the Chicago School took a strong ethnographic approach, the Birmingham School
                    favored the textual analysis of media and the semiotic analysis of cultural

                    British scholars specifically focused on subcultures based around distinctive

                    represented an enactment of stylistic resistance; a subversive reaction by young

                    their tendency to “seek out distinctive or deviant minority groups and to

                    fixed category of Third Culture Kids. A focus on collective deviance
                    alone—or distinction towards the home and host society in the case of
                    TCKs—precludes a thorough understanding of the complex practices, values,
                    and identities associated with youth culture. Fragmentation, fluidity,
                    consumerism, and media consumption have led to a rethinking of the term
                    “subculture” in favor of more temporary cultural groupings with

                    Research on diaspora and the role of ethnicity in youth culture has contributed

                    Additionally, their focus on the attention seeking and deviant behavior of
                    certain male youths excluded other everyday aspects of youth culture. Research
                    on these less noteworthy activities, however, can help us better understand the

                <p>While the Birmingham and Chicago studies understood youth mainly as a social

                    the cultural practices of young people today, observes that youth can be
                    understood as “a discursive construct expressing an increasingly varied
                    and, in many cases, conflicting range of political and aesthetic
                    sensibilities.” Contemporary cultural studies see the category of
                    “youth,” therefore, in contrast to definitions of
                    “adolescence” in developmental frameworks, as a “discursive
                    construct”—a perspective also found in popular discourse. Fuelled as
                    it is by the marketing of products and practices designed to help older adults
                    feel and look younger, today’s media shows that definitions of what it
                    means to be young are contested. Consequently, divisions in terms of leisure and
                    lifestyle preferences and practices across the generations become increasingly
                    less obvious (<xref rid="IDbd964410-1c08-4232-889e-f2edc9f820d2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3914848-81f0-49aa-af55-7fcd2046d852">Bennett 2007, 35</xref>).
                    Despite this fuzziness of the boundaries between youths and adults, Bennett
                    supports the utility of the term by convincingly arguing that differences

                    traditions. However, these early anthropological studies, in contrast to the
                    sociological and cultural studies approaches, did not investigate “youth
                    as a cultural category.” Rather, similar to developmental studies, they
                    investigated “adolescence as a biological and psychological stage of human
                    development” (Bucholtz <xref rid="ID891c23ec-aa76-47dc-b5be-dc26aa783c78" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc8a02667-e6cf-47d5-b2b1-86297e564cfd">2002</xref>,
                    525). In other words, they considered youth to be a process, which is why
                    anthropology’s tradition of researching adolescence still focuses on
                    change and development at the individual and cultural level. Its interest lies
                    in “the social staging of adolescence in particular cultural contexts in
                    which the universal developmental arc of adolescence is shaped by historically
                    speciﬁc processes of social, political, and economic transformation, as

                    criticizes these approaches because they are dominated by the teleology of the
                    developmental process from adolescence to adulthood. While she agrees that
                    developmental issues are certainly part of the study of youth, Bucholtz reminds
                    us that “the lived experience of young people is not limited to the uneasy
                    occupation of a developmental waystation en route to full-ﬂedged cultural
                    standing. It also involves its own distinctive identities and practices, which

                    influence on ‘achieving’ it, children’s activities are cast as
                    ancillary or subordinate. As a consequence, the contributions that children make

                <p>This unquestioning tendency to approach the subject from an adult perspective is

                    incompleteness […] while adult indicates both completion and
                    completeness.” In Bucholtz’s view, the category of youth therefore
                    understands age</p>

                            prolonged “search for identity,” nor the rigid and

                            ever-changing—but no more for youth than for people of any age.
                            Where the study of adolescence generally concentrates on how bodies and

                    scholars to “admit both the ideological reality of categories and the

                    “theories of practice, activity, and performance to demonstrate how youth
                    negotiate cultural identities in a variety of contexts, both material and

                <p>My own ethnographic approach to expatriate youths in Shanghai follows
                    Bucholtz’s objective. I highlight Paul’s and his fellow

                    their own accounts, while simultaneously capturing their everyday practices in
                    various locations, such as school, urban street spaces, and night clubs. My
                    underlying conceptual understanding of youth as practice, performance, and
                    negotiation is new for studies of expatriate youth because, until now, most
                    approaches were based on the retrospectives of adult “TCKs.”
                    Similarly, in migration studies in general, children’s perspectives are

                    recent approaches to research on childhood in the social and cultural sciences

                    her article “Unpacking children in migration research,” explains the

                    research. She argues that perceptions of children have long been based on ideas
                    stemming from economic models because of the prominent focus on economic aspects
                    of migration. According to these approaches, only adults are of economic
                    significance; therefore children are seen as irrelevant and ultimately ignored.
                    However, research on family migration and transnational families in particular
                    has received increasing attention. Such research argues against the economic
                    models by showing that children do in fact play a vital role in the migration
                    process and contribute to its (economic) success (Dobson <xref rid="IDbea8ef8e-44f3-43cd-ae89-b6750eb5d79a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd9f72554-65bf-4483-af1b-a8623e0901b0">2009</xref>, 356). Marjorie

                <p>Teresa Hutchins’s (<xref rid="IDd7c74262-237b-479f-b7ee-0f40a16b7d44" ref-type="bibr" id="ID44d583e6-47df-4fe6-bd32-846c375df519">2011</xref>)
                    study explores the experiences of families who have recently moved from the UK
                    to Australia. Her ethnographic account privileges the perspective of the
                    children in her study group, ages five to seventeen at the time of the
                    interviews, and discusses the ways in which they experienced and made sense of
                    the migration. Hutchins particularly analyzes the family’s decision-making
                    process prior to moving abroad and illustrates how different unspoken
                    conceptions of childhood influence this process, as parents often argue for
                    making decisions in their children’s “best interest.” As
                    “individual members of the family often have different interests,
                    […] family migration decision-making is based upon a process of
                    negotiating individual influence and power within the family” (Hutchins
                        <xref rid="IDd7c74262-237b-479f-b7ee-0f40a16b7d44" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfd3ed37c-af63-4514-835f-fdcdb9e6d76f">2011</xref>, 1233). While her
                    article lays open the use of parental power in these negotiations and
                    demonstrates how this power often results in the young actors’ exclusion
                    from the decision-making process, Hutchins also identifies ways in which
                    children actively attempt to influence the decision or the overall migration
                    process. Hutchins’ findings prompted me to discuss the events and
                    decisions that led to the move to Shanghai with Paul and his peers. Their
                    perspectives describe a lack of their involvement in this decision. Drinking
                    coffee on Wulumuqi Road, Paul tells me that he had not wanted to move to China
                    initially because he had not “even googled it before” and thought it
                    would be all “mud houses” and “bamboo forests.” He
                    remembers his father telling him about the move to China in a very
                    straightforward way: </p>

                            the dog, you know. So he was kinda like: “Paul, we are moving to

                <p>My work—in particular Part II, Chapter 1, which examines students’
                    perspectives on the decision to move abroad in depth—shows that this lack
                    of involvement in the decision, as in Paul’s case, leads to or at least
                    contributes to the youths’ initial reluctance to relocate to China and
                    that it renders the arrival more difficult for them.</p>
                <p>Another study by Madeleine Hatfield (née Dobson) (<xref rid="ID0e2fbbf1-4841-435d-8caf-51940061c269" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8620ebd3-701a-41da-b5de-e70d7f45208a">2010</xref>) addresses the issue
                    of return migration and presents, through innovative fieldwork on domestic
                    spaces in Britain, the experiences of “children as equal movers.”
                    The actors of her study are between seven and seventeen years old. They are
                    members of households headed by a highly skilled migrant and have returned
                    “home” to Britain after living in Singapore. Her work explores how
                    the children in her study understood and negotiated this return. Additionally,
                    by drawing on photography by the children, she highlights the significance of
                    their everyday routines and demonstrates children’s specific home-making
                    practices, which she often finds more “mobile, transient and
                    smaller-scale” than those of adults. Based on Hatfield’s insights,
                    Part III, Chapter 2 of this work discusses expatriate students’
                    home-making processes in Shanghai in more detail.</p>
                <p>Inspired by these case studies and the recent shift in youth studies—from
                    an emphasis on development to a focus on cultural practices and discursive
                    understandings of youth—this ethnography investigates expatriate
                    youths’ everyday activities and focuses on their own narratives. By
                    understanding age as a collective identity and not as a trajectory, I privilege
                    the experiences of the “here-and–now” over the process of
                    development. In order to capture these age-specific experiences, my work,
                    despite its focus on the lifestyle that comes with a particular mobility, mainly
                    addresses everyday routines at school, at leisure sites, or at home. The focus
                    on the youths’ own perspectives and experiences that informs my approach
                    has led to many passages in this ethnography in which the students’
                    experiences are described through their own words and testimonies. This
                    framework means that I focus on the youth’s relations with each other
                    rather than their relations with adults. I am well aware that their relations to
                    their parents and other adults might hereby be underrepresented. Nevertheless, I
                    think overcoming the “adult bias” and understanding the
                    youth’s own perspectives will contribute to the larger picture of
                    privileged migration. </p>
                <p>My choice of terminology reflects the outlined developments in the study of youth
                    and adapts them for the purposes of this book. I use the term
                    “youth” or “youths,” “young people,” or the
                    age-specific term “teenagers,” and not the term
                    “adolescent.” The latter implies a narrow developmental framework,
                    which I reject for my work. I acknowledge processes of development, but regard
                    transformation, change, and learning as something that is present not only in
                    youths’ lives, but for everyone. Because I worked with youths that were
                    enrolled at Shanghai’s numerous international schools, I also refer to my
                    research participants as “students.” Furthermore, I occasionally use
                    the term “children,” not in contrast to “adult,” but in
                    juxtaposition to “parents”—an understanding similar to
                    Hatfield’s (<xref rid="ID0e2fbbf1-4841-435d-8caf-51940061c269" ref-type="bibr" id="ID45230ece-69fc-49e1-90d8-d326d3dff5c5">2010,
                    247</xref>). I have done so to underline the young people’s dependency: at
                    the time of my fieldwork, all of the actors of my study still lived with one or
                    both parents. The term “expatriate,” or its short form
                    “expat,” is suited for my work because the student interviewees at
                    the international high schools in Shanghai all identified with it, regardless of
                    their parents’ occupations, nationalities, or migration trajectories.
                    “Expat” can therefore be seen as a term that refers to a shared set
                    of practices and privileges.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e280">10</xref>
                </p>
                <p>One more conceptual dimension needs to be addressed. While “expatriate
                    youth” is a suitable replacement of the TCK label for this particular
                    study, it does not offer any insights as an analytical concept with which to
                    investigate Paul’s and other international students’ mediations of
                    cultural complexities. For this I have to turn towards the notion of
                    transculturality and related ideas.</p>

                <p>There seems to be a common view that, in the broadest sense,
                    “transculturation is the process of individuals and societies changing
                    themselves by integrating diverse cultural life-ways into dynamic new
                    ones” (<xref rid="IDd82b6e19-5f50-487e-ae15-100d4399785d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID06181c87-fef7-4742-b39e-7e2fc69cb439">Hoerder, Hébert, and
                        Schmitt 2005, 13</xref>). Such notions disregard the fact that
                    transculturality or transculturation is not a “given” concept but
                    has its own conceptual history. Since the philosopher Wolfgang Welsch coined the
                    term “transculturality” (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc3b4c6de-172e-4ce5-b15e-47468b01a72d">Welsch 1999</xref>), a
                    burgeoning field has developed into an interdisciplinary pursuit that scholars
                    of various backgrounds have approached from a variety of angles. </p>
                <p>Welsch (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="ID30c4fb15-312a-477b-a425-41998f5fb1a9">1999</xref>) developed the term
                    “transculturality” to challenge the classical idea of singular
                    cultures and more recent concepts of interculturality and multiculturality. He
                    strongly criticizes these concepts and has argued that cultures are not
                    “constituted in the form of islands or spheres” (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="ID12976c6e-63cc-4753-b43a-fcdd56fc7bf0">1999</xref>, 197). The idea of
                    transculturality, according to Welsch, can solve the misconception that cultures
                    have “the insinuated form of homogeneity and separateness” (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb2688815-36d7-4b41-81d3-13b281a11b43">ibid.</xref>). The concept of
                    transculturality, Welsch argues, “sketches a different picture of the
                    relation between cultures. Not one of isolation and of conflict, but one of
                    entanglement, intermixing and commonness” (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="IDff137264-5925-4076-8517-fda747435f01">ibid.</xref>). Furthermore,
                    Welsch also acknowledges transculturality not only on society’s macro
                    level, but also on the individual level: “Work on one’s identity is
                    becoming more and more work on the integration of components of differing
                    cultural origin” (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="ID82cd4df7-2abf-4ba6-8713-fc4c5cb8e8ef">ibid.</xref>).
                    Unfortunately, as cultural anthropologist Gertraud Koch (<xref rid="IDe5ad10f8-a471-4ef4-b131-e32997955ac4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1206fe07-1a25-4370-a4f2-1efabdcb2189">2008, 14</xref>) points out,
                    Welsch’s development of transculturation is rather generalizing and not
                    based on specific examples.</p>

                    transculturality on the individual level and pursued a biographical approach by
                    presenting texts “of a range of curious, open-minded protagonists who

                    that the volume focuses on transnationally mobile persons. The aspect of
                    cultural identity they pursue is based on the underlying premise that certain
                    individuals “find ways to transcend their native cultures, in order to
                    explore, examine and infiltrate new, seemingly alien cultures” and that
                    these experiences show that “it will become increasingly difficult to
                    identify and separate people according to previously accepted
                    delineations” (<xref rid="IDb3a136ca-0021-4b1b-9f7a-472574f7c85f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID910671d3-4e81-4f82-b0a1-373214693903">ibid.</xref>).
                    The chosen protagonists, from their point of view, are defined as
                    “transcultural personalities […] because of their willingness to
                    rise to the challenge of living in unfamiliar, sometimes even hostile,
                    societies, and forge new, hybrid narratives of identity for themselves, without
                    compromising their own individuality and cultural heritage” (<xref rid="IDb3a136ca-0021-4b1b-9f7a-472574f7c85f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2ac2c774-0436-428c-88e6-9a4ca0634caf">Berg and Éigeartaigh 2010a,

                <p>Éigearteigh and Berg term these individuals “transculturalists”
                    and argue that looking closely at their experiences and narratives provides
                    insights into “the conditions under which cultural change takes

                    optimistic outlook on transculturality as a state that “can help the

                    that transculturality offers an identity model through which TCKs can be
                    understood. Her work combines the popular concept of TCKs with a theoretical
                    interpretation of transculturality. Richter draws on Welsch’s concept and
                    understands transculturality mainly as “jenseits des Gegensatzes von

                    argues that TCKs encounter diverse cultural elements, bridge several cultures,
                    and are marked by being part of a third, newly-formed culture. Consequently,
                    Richter argues that TCKs represent and articulate different cultures,
                    cross-cultural values, and norms (“kulturübergreifende Werte und

                    “cultures” which are unfortunately still based on a problematic
                    understanding of homogeneity. This tendency stems from Welsch’s
                    understanding of transculturality, according to which cultures have a
                    “core” (Kern). As Brosius and Wenzlhuemer (<xref rid="ID47fb070b-06af-46ae-99f6-b872933e33bb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID13e495f8-b007-4973-b8db-89ef77209117">2011, 11</xref>) argue,
                    “the matter is even more complicated since we must reflect on the role of

                    essentialising them.” </p>
                <p>For my analysis, the terms “transculturalist,” “TCK,” and
                    “transcultural personalities” are too static because they presuppose
                    a specific, mixed identity that is in opposition to fixed
                    “authentic” others. Processes of cultural identity negotiations,
                    however, are flexible, relational, and situational. My work does follow
                    Richter’s (<xref rid="ID3d4d34ae-44e8-481f-914d-352e2837f5ff" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb058b2f3-6251-43f5-9072-a2e5d6f71ac2">2011</xref>)
                    initial linking of TCKs—or better, expatriate youths—with
                    transculturality. However, my ethnographic approach goes beyond Richter’s
                    account, which is based on established narratives of people who label themselves
                    as TCKs, by including practices that contradict or impair the building of the
                    “transcultural personalities” that Richter sees. To analyze such
                    contradicting practices—for instance the retreat from urban China to
                    comfortable and familiar expatriate enclaves in Shanghai—it is necessary
                    to go beyond Welsch’s notion of transculturality as a state of being. </p>
                <p>In contrast, transculturality’s dynamic processes have received more
                    attention from authors such as Fernando Ortiz, whose early writings on what he
                    termed “transculturation” were seemingly unknown to Welsch when he
                    coined his term. Ortiz developed the concept of transculturation in the 1940s,
                    in his work Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6e56c06d-7ba7-4445-b924-6e7c76d6ec71">Ortiz 1970</xref>), which
                    analyzes the production of these crops in Cuba. Based on empirical evidence,
                    Ortiz describes the rapid global spread of tobacco farming and assesses the
                    reasons for its change in “social significance as it passed from the
                    cultures of the New World to those of the Old.” He calls this process
                    “the transculturation of tobacco” (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfd7cb4d2-af7f-4a94-8b18-de5cb560b7c6">ibid., 183</xref>) and argues
                    that transculturation defines what he saw as “the highly varied phenomena
                    that have come about in Cuba as a result of the extremely complex transmutations
                    of culture that have taken place here” (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5388a9c9-18e6-44e1-96a4-db0f00179558">ibid., 98</xref>). The term, he
                    claims, more adequately describes these historical events than the term
                    “acculturation,” which had been frequently employed until then to
                    describe similar processes (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0bbebcac-b0ac-4298-bcd8-5fbb2d7435eb">ibid.,

                    the introduction to Ortiz’s book, supports the term and claims that
                    “acculturation” is “an ethnocentric word” that connotes
                    the idea that “the ‘uncultured’ is to receive the benefits of
                    ‘our culture’.” He argues that “by the use of the term
                    acculturation we implicitly introduce a series of moral, normative, and
                    evaluative concepts which radically vitiate the real understanding of the

                    early acknowledgement of the emancipatory potential that lies in the concept of
                    transculturation. It shows, according to Koch, that “the dominant
                    culture” does not remain uninfluenced in this process (<xref rid="IDe5ad10f8-a471-4ef4-b131-e32997955ac4" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfa04b02e-1966-4e0a-be4a-1bfd71080d04">ibid.</xref>). Yet, while
                    Ortiz’s concept of transculturation emphasizes the creative processes of
                    new formations, it remains problematically close to essentializing

                    “transculturality in progress” is highly sensitive to the dangers of
                    essentializing culture and describes migratory milieus, cooperative spaces, and
                    transcultural relations as the “frames in which people with different
                    cultural backgrounds perceive the difference of cultures and negotiate their
                    identity and self-design” (<xref rid="ID91788eee-7eed-47c1-a8a4-a7c6014101c2" ref-type="bibr" id="ID79d24a4d-6133-433b-b00e-2737ec4d1dc5">ibid., 9</xref>). Instead of
                    talking about distinct cultures, Nadig suggests that “experiences,
                    emotions, perceptions of others, and strategic positions are consciously and
                    discursively modelled along the forming of affiliations, the drawing of

                    If we base our understanding of transculturality on a concept of culture that,

                    culture “as plural and in motion” and defines it “as a
                    practice,” we can use transculturality as a concept to investigate
                    “the development and transformation of identity constructs within the
                    context of transcultural relations,” and focus on “the subsequently
                    developed forms of translation, convergence, mergence, the new boundaries, and
                    differentiation.” According to Nadig, transculturality leads us to analyze
                    both “the context within which individuals and groups interact” and
                    “the material, discursive and practical manifestations of cultural
                    identity and their change to the extent that mutual (transcultural)
                    understanding is either made possible or impaired” (<xref rid="ID91788eee-7eed-47c1-a8a4-a7c6014101c2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDac3d9a3b-c053-45d8-b366-72d109e9aef0">ibid.</xref>).</p>
                <p>Many of Paul and his peers’ spatial practices that I will discuss
                    throughout this ethnography are linked to boundaries that often impair exchanges
                    and understanding with local Chinese youth, such as the physical, social, and
                    cultural boundaries of gated communities and international schools. Their forms
                    of belonging and identity positioning, however, demonstrate the students’
                    own perspectives and identification with being “in-between” and
                    their need to improve their (transcultural) understanding in various contexts.
                    Nadig shows that, in cultural studies and psychoanalysis, similar

                    such mediations. While some students negotiate between differences they perceive
                    between their parents and themselves, others mediate between school and home, or
                    across dividing lines in class between their former social networks and their

                    are also strategic elements in such identity negotiations. Writing about
                    entrepreneurs of Turkish origin in Berlin, he sees transculturality as practice.
                    This concept explains and resolves a contradiction between the theoretical
                    standpoint that homogeneous cultures do not exist on the one hand, and the
                    everyday use and experience of signs and practices that permanently (re)produce
                    such essentializations of fixed, homogenous cultures, on the other. Pütz
                    does not consider cultural embeddedness to be something fixed, but argues that
                    it is created through communicative practices in a specific situation and is
                    thus open to change (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3d7b1947-0cf2-4794-b8d7-5ce4bf05f39d">ibid.,

                    an individual’s social practice but understands these systems as forming a
                    “repertoire” to which the individual has access and from which he or

                    such an interpretative and symbolic understanding of culture, Pütz’s
                    concept of transculturality as practice begs the question of why cultural
                    boundaries are drawn (Pütz <xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID910ccb01-799b-48e0-824a-368a983af9ec">2004</xref>, 11), rather than
                    inquiring about the state of seemingly homogenous cultures. Concepts of

                    self-positioning on both sides of certain borders can, according to
                    Pütz’s view, be seen as the ability of individuals to deal flexibly
                    with codifications of identity (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd6b11cb0-0ddd-4053-8ab8-cf92e19c0653">ibid.</xref>). He takes up the
                    idea formulated by Welsch (<xref rid="ID91be8678-18f1-4b15-8632-0b2a75bd8bde" ref-type="bibr" id="ID63477586-812c-4d6f-9729-15c9ae0b5071">1999</xref>)
                    that individuals possess or have access to different cultural frames of
                    reference. Pütz (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID203849c1-2e62-498d-9c32-f9a906fd8b65">2004, 27</xref>)
                    maintains that, with the help of the concept of transculturality, the
                    inner-outer differentiation that comes with every border is conceptually shifted
                    onto the individual. Furthermore, Pütz sees transculturality as an
                    observational concept (Beobachtungskonzept) (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID51716eae-ef52-44f4-9bae-781eade1e61e">ibid., 13</xref>) or analyzing
                    concept (Analysekonzept) (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5ecf263d-dc85-400f-ba86-6ab077f015d5">ibid.</xref>,
                    28) that can serve the researcher as a methodological tool. Transculturality is
                    a useful tool for sharpening one’s focus and shedding light on the
                    cultural aspects of practices, their borders, and their entanglements.
                    Consequently, it can, as Brosius and Wenzlhuemer (<xref rid="ID47fb070b-06af-46ae-99f6-b872933e33bb" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa799955e-50bd-4b1b-912d-2d315fe49677">2011, 11</xref>) put it,

                    analytical method.”</p>
                <p>Pütz defines transculturality as a certain practice of specific subjects,
                    which can be divided into “everyday transculturality” and
                    “strategic transculturality” (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2a55e2a5-2dc9-44d8-9070-7dd0aeba4365">ibid., 13</xref>) and describes
                    the former as concrete routines with which the subjects are able to position
                    themselves in different frames of reference (Deutungsschemata). If these frames
                    of reference are reflected upon by their actors and used intentionally,
                    “everyday transculturality” becomes “strategic
                    transculturality.” “Strategic transculturality” means moving
                    self-reflexively in different symbolic systems (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6c50cab8-c9c5-4a46-86f2-691fb7de2c03">Pütz 2004, 28</xref>), and
                    is reminiscent of what the British social anthropologist Steven Vertovec (<xref rid="ID7f5cd3d1-f0e5-4660-9474-04bff121b7c4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID525d885a-8ef4-4a0d-971f-275784653b08">1997, 294</xref>) described

                            celebrate new mixtures, the former indicate ways in which individuals
                            not only create syncretic forms, but are competent in—and can
                            improvise from—a number of (in some ways discrete, in some ways
                            overlapping) cultural and linguistic systems (<xref rid="ID7f5cd3d1-f0e5-4660-9474-04bff121b7c4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID97a5a32f-b464-4eb3-8658-e62aff6af99a">Vertovec 1997,

                <p>This competence in “milieu moving” is, for instance, illustrated by
                    one of the students I met in Shanghai, Xia, who was raised in Germany by his
                    Chinese parents, and who describes how alternating between his German school in
                    Shanghai and his home forces him to alter his role, speech, and behavior to suit
                    each location. Such a self-reflective practice of strategic transculturality
                    also enables us to understand Paul’s way of labeling himself differently
                    in regards to nationality, as he did during our talk on Wulumuqi Road. This
                    becomes even clearer when we meet again a few months later in Germany. Triggered
                    by leaving Shanghai and his move to Germany, he suddenly labels himself
                    Brazilian. It is a strategic decision based on his judgment of what actually
                    might be accepted and confirmed by others in his new situation. Paul expresses
                    no worries about his recent choice to move to Germany after graduating and
                    stresses his ability to adapt anywhere—especially as his private,
                    English-language university provides another international “bubble.”
                    During this second interview in Germany, he conveys a calmness and
                    effortlessness about his many relocations—and his recent move to Germany
                    in particular—before he suddenly tells me he considers himself Brazilian,
                    now, even though he only lived in Brazil until he was six years old. I am
                    surprised by his new choice of cultural identity. While I wonder whether my
                    presence makes him feel obliged to make a statement of belonging, he lists his
                    very pragmatic reasons for this choice by explaining why his other places of
                    upbringing are unsuitable to define him: he simply does not want to identify
                    himself as American and, given the way he looks, he cannot be Chinese. </p>
                <p>Paul’s way of thinking about and rationally arguing for his current
                    cultural identity in Germany can clearly be seen as strategic in Robert
                    Pütz’s (<xref rid="ID91788eee-7eed-47c1-a8a4-a7c6014101c2" ref-type="bibr" id="ID421c29c7-2e23-436c-ab29-b315949e3f24">2004</xref>)

                    that actors themselves have self-reflective access to culture—a necessary
                    premise to use transculturality strategically. I find Pütz’s argument
                    for self-reflective actors who continuously (and sometimes strategically)
                    re-position themselves by drawing from their “cultural repertoire”
                        (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID30307550-c770-41ec-86b9-e1e5ba502b50">ibid., 29</xref>), thus
                    simultaneously adding to this “repertoire” more convincing than the

                    young privileged migrants to cultural practices and the consequent (strategic)
                    mediations between inner/individual and outer/cultural realities (Nadig <xref rid="ID91788eee-7eed-47c1-a8a4-a7c6014101c2" ref-type="bibr" id="ID21936613-78d1-4965-a5e3-d62a059af811">2004</xref>), I suggest framing
                    their experiences, viewpoints, and practices in terms of gaining and employing
                    “transcultural perspectives.”</p>
                <p>This ethnography examines and presents in detail how young privileged migrants
                    like Paul view and narrate their experiences of moving and how they consequently
                    construct subjective flexible cultural identities. Their stories show that
                    “culture” is, as an ever-changing set of practices and meanings in
                    an on-going process, “plural and in motion” (<xref rid="ID91788eee-7eed-47c1-a8a4-a7c6014101c2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd9a3cb1d-49b6-44d6-9a7c-e1d4bd276339">Nadig 2004, 10</xref>). This
                    understanding of “culture” has been widespread in the discipline of
                    anthropology since well before the rise of transcultural studies, as Akhil Gupta
                    and James Ferguson (<xref rid="ID2df8adbd-e2fb-4cd2-a7f7-0a45d23744f7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf3b3fc5a-2ffb-443e-b626-1864d77d1df1">1992</xref>),
                    for example, have put forward by calling for a focus on the production of
                    cultural differences rather than viewing “culture” as a distinct
                    entity. I draw on this understanding of “cultures” as continuous
                    processes when speaking of transcultural perspectives. By using the term
                    “perspectives,” I additionally emphasize the idea of
                    self-reflexivity, the ability to focus and reflect on the processes that
                    manifest our understandings of “cultures” and their boundaries. For
                    this reason, I agree with Brosius’ assertion that transculturality also
                    serves as a heuristic device (<xref rid="ID1aead012-70be-4e04-a271-90e97aff38ae" ref-type="bibr" id="IDab921f0b-7b1e-4f70-97ed-3760322b04ce">Brosius 2011,

                <p>Based on my accounts of 43 expatriate youths in Shanghai in 2010, 2011, and 2012,
                    I show that many of these students, especially those born of bicultural
                    marriages or to parents with migrant biographies, develop such a transcultural
                    perspective toward their own lives, a perspective that is highly self-reflective
                    upon their mobility and position, and the influence that family, the school
                    environment, or Shanghai has on them. The term “perspective,” which
                    is common in transcultural studies, was even explicitly used by one student who
                    was already mentioned, Xia—the son of Chinese parents, who grew up in
                    Germany and was enrolled at a German school—to describe his challenges and
                    desire to cope with such variations in his immediate environment. Despite the
                    fact that my presence might have triggered some of the students’
                    reflections and influenced them accordingly, I argue that transculturality as a
                    method or specific perspective is not only reserved for the anthropologist or
                    the academic, but is a form of reflection acquired by many of the teenagers who
                    shared their experiences with me. Many students develop such self-reflexivity
                    about their own entanglement as a coping strategy for a lifestyle of constant
                    moving, whether it is they or their close friends who move.</p>
                <p>This transcultural perspective on their own lives may at first seem to contradict
                    the youths’ everyday spatial practices of demarcation, such as
                    Paul’s bubble. However, spatial demarcations and transcultural
                    perspectives actually go hand-in-hand. The students’ own mobility can
                    evoke a desire for stability on the one hand and a desire to broaden their point
                    of view in order to manage the changes they experience on the other. Living on
                    the move by no means erases but instead often provokes the desire to create
                    familiar spaces, to settle despite having to face the next move. Thus a constant
                    negotiation takes place between drawing boundaries and crossing them. </p>
                <p>When applied by the researcher, a transcultural perspective sheds light on how
                    these youths shift and merge different cultural practices, positions, and
                    creative formations of new subjectivities. It can also serve to inform moments
                    of boundary-drawing and practices of making distinctions.</p>
                <p>During the interviews, I get the impression that Paul, like me, has difficulty
                    grasping the full breadth of the changes he has experienced throughout his
                    lifetime. Instead of describing or contemplating these differences that he
                    experiences like the other students, Paul simply describes what has helped him
                    to emplace himself: the social worlds of “bubbles.” It is thus
                    impossible to understand the “transcultural turbulences” (<xref rid="ID47fb070b-06af-46ae-99f6-b872933e33bb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7f01e276-d7b1-4b0a-b07d-85be9c3ae89c">Brosius and Wenzlhuemer

                    cultural identity by people like Paul, without a more detailed ethnographic

                    ethnographic insights into the production of cultural differences at specific
                    sites. For this reason, I chose to investigate expatriate youths’ spatial

                    places favored by expatriate youths and connects them to their experience of
                    Shanghai as a rising mega-city, as well as to their memories of places
                    elsewhere. With this emphasis, I not only contribute to filling the gap of
                    research on geographies of youth that scholars have recently turned to (e.g. the
                    founding of the journal Children’s Geographies), but also attune my work
                    to methodologies in ethnographic studies that foreground the importance of place

                    studying phenomena of migration. The lives of the individuals

                    the researcher’s reflective choices inevitably limit the field in any
                    approach: “Ultimately, both [single- and multi-sited approaches] are
                    partial because both have their self-/imposed limits. Multi-sited ethnography is
                    no more holistically inclined than its predessor [sic]” (<xref rid="ID44e974ca-05ca-4942-be0e-e108cd171049" ref-type="bibr" id="ID95c65b18-9d4d-4519-aa13-b8d666ac2f07">ibid., 13</xref>).</p>
                <p>Despite focusing exclusively on Shanghai, my work is informed by the strong
                    global connections across multiple and large spatial scales that are part of
                    expatriate youth’s everyday lives. Expatriate children have often already
                    moved several times. The continuous presence of these places in the
                    students’ lives is obvious not only in narratives of migration
                    experiences, but particularly through the constant comparison of Shanghai to
                    former places of residence. Furthermore, daily practices involve memories of
                    other places that are constantly evoked through material connections (clothes or
                    furniture bought elsewhere), sensuous experiences (food from home), and
                    emotional paraphernalia (a postcard or an email from a close friend abroad).

                    connections permeate our everyday lives: “Within a topological

                <p>Robinson’s approach helps us to understand that, for the students in my
                    ethnography, the process of moving through and living in Shanghai is constantly
                    tied to that which is elsewhere.</p>
                <p>By acknowledging the continuous presence of other places in our daily lives, as
                    it arises through the global circulation of people, images, technology, goods,
                    money, and ideas—which anthropologist Arjun Appadurai (<xref rid="ID854192fc-caff-486c-8097-c43ba1ba60f5" ref-type="bibr" id="IDab28494f-4b70-426e-bf38-84e8138042fc">1996</xref>) has conceptualized
                    as ethno-, media-, techno-, finance-, and ideoscapes—we can observe that
                    global cultural flows touch down in specific sites. For children on the move
                    with their expatriate parents, this means that, although they may grow up
                    transnationally, they always live somewhere particular, if only for a limited
                    time. Brenda Yeoh and Katie Willis (<xref rid="ID6b47e04b-a79c-4729-8c6f-9fea94212700" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1ff6e496-86b8-4329-8cf6-150d8213cbc8">2005, 270</xref>) point out that
                    “transnational elites belong as much to the ‘space of place’
                    as to the ‘space of flows’,” and so do their children.
                    Choosing to ground my research in Shanghai, I therefore decided not to focus on
                    the links of one expatriate community to another, or the relations of family
                    members dispersed across the globe, but rather to see how these global
                    connections are negotiated in the everyday spaces of expatriate youths.</p>
                <p>Consequently, my methodological approach follows those concepts of ethnography
                    that promote the idea of grounding ethnographic research in particular sites, as
                    scholars such as Zsuzsa Gille and Seán Ó Riain (<xref rid="ID6cd019ce-23ee-437a-b6db-342924a5615a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4df13a03-ce57-4b90-935d-d0f80501cacd">2002</xref>) or Harri Englund

                    These approaches argue that focusing on specific places enables us to gain
                    insight into the global networks of each site’s actors: “We have
                    argued for a global ethnography that still locates itself firmly in places but
                    which conceives of those places as themselves globalized with multiple external
                    connections, porous and contested boundaries, and social relations that are
                    constructed across multiple spatial scales” (Gille and Ó Riain <xref rid="ID6cd019ce-23ee-437a-b6db-342924a5615a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDaa7a0644-965a-4fe7-b063-dc6f55770824">2002</xref>, 290–291).</p>
                <p>Similar to Gille and Ó Riain’s suggested perspectives on specific
                    places as “globalized with multiple external connections,” Englund
                    promotes a methodological focus on sites in recognition of their global
                    connections. Englund (<xref rid="ID34478bce-cace-4442-a29c-46e37b3384c8" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe386d20d-9ab6-4c33-b865-3832f26006b1">2002,
                    286</xref>), however, rejects the concept of localization due to its inherent
                    misleading dichotomy as the opposite of globalization, and suggests a
                    “postglobalist” perspective that works with the idea of
                    “emplacement”—a term anthropologist David Howes (<xref rid="ID765f705e-646d-4074-897d-17cc9de86205" ref-type="bibr" id="ID36ae0fcd-ec9e-4dfc-bbc2-63b97bc710ce">[2005]2006, 7</xref>) later
                    formed into a full-fledged concept that focuses on the “sensuous
                    interrelationship of body-mind-environment”—to enhance sensitivity
                    to situatedness in a globalized world. Englund’s perspective enables an
                    emphasis to be placed on the transformation of global elements in particular
                    places:</p>
                <p>
                    <disp-quote id="dispquote10">
                        <p> This perspective is postglobalist because it both builds on earlier
                            insights into flows and circulations in a global space, and it
                            recognizes specific sites and terrains as the conditions of their
                            existence and transformation. Even the apparently most global phenomenon
                            is continuously emplaced as it reaches its new destinations. As such,
                            localization is doubly disqualified to capture the contours of
                            emplacement. Not only does it evoke globalization as its logical
                            opposite, it also conveys a sense of closure in local appropriations. If
                            persons, institutions, and capital are always emplaced, the challenge is
                            to understand the variable capacities of places to act as springboards
                            for traveling, whether by people, ideas, or institutions (<xref rid="ID34478bce-cace-4442-a29c-46e37b3384c8" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa51d5d0a-3aa9-4193-a3ce-28be9cd0a43f">Englund 2002,

                    postglobalist perspective supports my focus on Shanghai and the various specific
                    locales within it. The methodological approaches by Gille and Ó Riain as
                    well as Englund, however, prompt a consideration of the global connections these
                    places are part of: “Not only is the so-called local an emergent property
                    of nonlocal processes, the so-called global also requires particular sites and
                    terrains to operate” (Englund <xref rid="ID2e7aa643-3e28-43ae-a9ff-70d4828bac67" ref-type="bibr" id="ID276fc1ee-be92-4e6f-adae-fe9a94ffcd35">2002</xref>, 266). Willis, Yeoh,
                    and Fakhri (<xref rid="ID2e7aa643-3e28-43ae-a9ff-70d4828bac67" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6ad7e97d-9c2a-41b0-9758-5a3c2cd07828">2002, 506</xref>) have pointed
                    out how this principle works within expatriate spheres: “Transnational
                    elites may be evidence of processes at a global scale, but this
                    ‘global’ is constructed and understood by operations of particular
                    individuals in local spaces.” A postglobalist perspective is thus useful
                    for my research because it enables an understanding of expatriate youths’
                    ways of life not only as the outcome of globalization, but sees these
                    individuals as mobile yet emplaced actors.</p>
                <p>To understand their experience of specific places in Shanghai further, my
                    research on spatial practices is also theoretically informed by Howes’s
                        (<xref rid="ID765f705e-646d-4074-897d-17cc9de86205" ref-type="bibr" id="ID87473bb9-75e8-424a-9dd9-3b809a32b696">[2005] 2006</xref>) idea of
                    “emplacement” that I mentioned above. His concept of emplacement
                    encourages paying particular attention to a variety of sensory impressions and
                    enables us to recognize and highlight the importance of physical and emotional
                    experiences in specific places. I therefore understand emplacement as the
                    process of engaging with the “here and now.”</p>
                <p>Furthermore, ethnographer and filmmaker David MacDougall’s (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID331cb464-67a0-4801-8b3e-d230e5511f2a">2006</xref>) notion of
                    “social aesthetics” is helpful in highlighting the sensorial and
                    embodied experiences of the youths’ preferred spaces in Shanghai. He
                    suggests paying attention to specific objects, such as “the design of
                    buildings and grounds” or “the use of clothing and colors,”
                    and daily practices, “for instance the organization of students’
                    time,” to understand the “social aesthetics” of an environment
                        (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdf55bf36-c9c7-4c7c-863a-49c5686b4bf1">2006</xref>, 98). By
                    understanding the “social aesthetic field” as a coalescence of
                    different elements such as “objects and actions” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID27459747-32d2-4604-99e1-ac9d8d7653c7">2006, 98</xref>), we can then
                    analyze it by focusing on a specific community, its material environment, and
                    the quotidian practices that occur within it. Social aesthetics are “both
                    the backdrop and product of everyday life” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4bde5f65-9d65-489f-b8f4-a26824bc466c">ibid., 108</xref>).
                    MacDougall’s notion directly relates to my own fieldwork experience. For
                    example, the aforementioned concept explains how the social aesthetics of a
                    classroom (the room’s shape, lighting, and seating arrangements, which for
                    students are intertwined with specific behavioral rules) can influence the range
                    or depth of topics of the interviews I conducted at the students’ schools.
                    In these discussions, school-related issues were elaborated upon more than
                    leisure activities. MacDougall’s idea of social aesthetics thus helps us
                    to further understand how the materiality and atmosphere of select places can
                    foster certain practices or discussions among the youths, whether it be the
                    school premises (Part III, Chapter 3) that evokes a certain behavior and
                    conversation topics, or a nightclub (Part IV, Chapter 2) that promotes certain
                    ways of dressing up. It demonstrates the students’ active involvement in
                    creating their own spaces as well as their roles in shaping Shanghai as a world
                    city and stage for their own identity performances. </p>

                    reciprocal. Massey (<xref rid="ID41150e8e-3de9-4828-8323-7cc083dafc42" ref-type="bibr" id="ID71d5d237-e64f-426a-8536-6ad720a3c2a2">1998</xref>) has
                    shown that this is particularly true for age identities. This correspondence is
                    striking when looking at spatial ordering within populations, for example, which
                    individuals are allowed on a playground vs. a cinema or bar, and which are not.
                    As Massey notes, “indeed the very drawing of age lines and the definition
                    of the spaces where particular age groups are allowed is part of the process of
                    defining an age group in the first place. The control of spatiality is part of
                    the process of defining the social category of ‘youth’ itself”
                        (<xref rid="ID41150e8e-3de9-4828-8323-7cc083dafc42" ref-type="bibr" id="ID168ce52c-cbbd-4fb1-a6be-f64770550916">Massey 1998, 129</xref>).
                    Massey’s argument of reciprocity thus helped me to analyze how these
                    particular teenagers’ identity constructions and their typical
                    performances were related to specific locations in the city of Shanghai.</p>
                <p>In summary, in addition to focusing on cultural identity negotiations and
                    youths’ age-specific perspectives, my third theoretical and methodological
                    focus analyzes expatriate youths’ everyday spatial practices and their
                    (dis)engagement with the “local” to find out what role
                    “place” plays in their lives on the move. This is not an attempt to
                    understand culture geographically. Rather, by following approaches in
                    post-global ethnography, I aim to highlight how these teenagers embed different
                    global elements in a host of particularities. Examining physical experiences of
                    particular places in Shanghai provides a foundation for the overall experience
                    of mobility that this ethnography traces.</p>

                </title>
                <p>Paul’s story exemplifies how entangled expatriate youths’ positions
                    toward their cultural identities can be. To gain a detailed understanding of
                    such processes of positioning and forms of belonging, this ethnography will
                    illustrate international youths’ subjective and collective experiences and
                    ways of managing migration processes. It will chronologically delineate the
                    expatriate students’ experiences of the decision to move, their arrival,
                    ways of life and how they rationalize their stay, as well as the moment of
                    leaving and moving on. Following this central narrative, the transit space of
                    Shanghai will unfold successively, affording insights into its various spaces
                    and meanings for expatriate youths. This book will also highlight how the
                    majority of the teenagers in Shanghai understand it as a temporary or transitory
                    space, and a liminal phase in their lives, or, as my seventeen-year-old
                    interviewee Giovanni, who had been living in Shanghai for three years at the
                    time of the interview, described it: “You are only here for a temporary
                    period; like a long vacation.” This book will follow, capture, and
                    conceptualize this experience of “passing through,” of transient
                    emplacement.</p>
                <p>To understand this experience in more depth, my ethnography will center on three
                    main aspects, the theoretical foundations of which I have laid out in this
                    introduction: the process of cultural identity negotiation, the age-specific
                    experience of expatriation, and the role of places in a life on the move. This
                    book therefore seeks answers to the following questions: How can we understand
                    these mobile youths in terms of cultural identity? How do youths experience the
                    move to Shanghai and how does their age shape that experience? And, finally,
                    what roles do specific places and the city of Shanghai play in their globally
                    connected lives? In addressing these questions, the individual chapters will
                    focus on various aspects of the lives of young expatriates.</p>
                <p>Part I, “Getting Acquainted,” introduces the international youths
                    whose lifestyles and world views I examine. It also depicts how I, as a
                    researcher, approached and encountered expatriate students in Shanghai. The part
                    opens with a summary of the general situation and size of the expatriate
                    communities in Shanghai. Insights into the daily routines of international
                    school life and portrayals of two peer groups follow, before I introduce the
                    individual experiences of four expatriate teenagers. </p>
                <p>Part II, “Leaving,” provides the youths’ retrospectives of the
                    circumstances that led to their relocation to Shanghai. Chapter 1 shows that
                    many of the teenagers felt they were denied an active role in the
                    decision-making process regarding the move and were often reluctant or initially
                    even against the idea of moving abroad. Connected to discussions about leaving,
                    Chapter 2 delineates the emotional challenges of moving to Shanghai. Based on
                    the students’ commentary, it identifies their “culture shock,”
                    their reaction to an unfamiliar urban environment, new sensory impressions, and
                    a lack of friends and extended family, as well as problems within the family
                    related to the move. The different experiences of youths all underline that the
                    times of leaving and arriving—or what Ahmed, Castañeda, Fortier, and
                    Sheller (<xref rid="IDee995414-c023-4f02-9b93-e65c6b8914a4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID852f623b-ac5d-4e12-959a-e37c3b877fcd">2003</xref>) call
                    “uprootings”—are highly emotional.</p>
                <p>Part III, “Arriving,” describes students’ everyday practices
                    upon arrival in Shanghai and their agency in making Shanghai their new home and
                    community. Chapter 1 presents different students’ ways of making sense of
                    their new urban environment, not just in terms of navigation and sensorial
                    experiences, but also in terms of positioning themselves within the city. It
                    demonstrates that managing the city means managing everyday life and the
                    experience of migration, for instance by learning how to navigate between spaces
                    of everyday practices and consumption, by giving spaces a social meaning, or by
                    dividing Shanghai into familiar areas and “the city.” Chapter 2 is
                    concerned with practices and notions of home. After providing a detailed
                    description of expatriate housing spaces—gated communities—it
                    identifies youths’ small-scale home-making practices, such as room
                    decorating or family dinners, as well as larger processes of locating
                    “home(s)” in their transnational networks. It demonstrates that, due
                    to the expatriate teenagers’ experiences of mobility, “home”
                    is a fluid concept with no single location and is simultaneously tied to various
                    places, items, and people. It becomes evident that making and (re)imagining
                    home(s), or collecting material goods to produce a sense of belonging, helps
                    these teenagers to manage feelings of loneliness. For a deeper understanding of
                    these practices and the notion of “home,” the chapter draws on
                    Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfa1b8a5d-2407-4400-85de-6fbe6ddb02fa">1987</xref>) concept of the
                    rhizome. Chapter 3 examines the spaces of international schools and their
                    critical roles as important nodes of the expatriate communities in Shanghai. The
                    schools are sites for the continuous everyday routine of expatriate youths, as
                    well as the place for meeting new friends and for engaging in various leisure
                    activities. Chapter 3 also identifies how these schools underpin certain
                    narratives of what it means to be an expatriate and illustrates how they foster
                    the development of collective identities and provide a sense of community for
                    many of the students and their families. Conversations with students also reveal
                    that their perspective of being enrolled at an international school is linked to
                    the interdependent feelings of privilege and pressure.</p>
                <p>Part IV, “Living,” zooms in on particular age-specific spatial and
                    social practices and foregrounds the youths’ efforts to create their own
                    spaces. Discussions on age identities in Chapter 1 and ethnographic evidence
                    from nightlife practices in Chapter 2 underline how the construction of
                    collective age identities and related spaces are crucial for teenagers to gain
                    meaning and agency in their migration experience. Chapter 3 provides a specific
                    example of a teenage hangout spot close to the school campus which they refer to
                    as “the shop”—a little street with eateries, a snack shop, and
                    pool tables. This small alley constitutes an “open space” (<xref rid="ID935f5f0f-6c8e-40a5-a618-208c262c32fb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8eef41df-403a-4ed6-8130-6fae48ab29a4">Hassenpflug 2009,
                        31–33</xref>) in the city, which is shaped by the habits and economic
                    interests of the shop-owners, as well as by the youths’ own agency and
                    interests. Here local Chinese shop-owners, customers, and expatriate youths can
                    meet. For the youths, most importantly, the shop provides an everyday space
                    that, unlike the gated communities or the international schools where they spend
                    most of their time, is not characterized by explicit behavioral expectations or
                    rules. Chapter 4 investigates the teenagers’ relations to China and
                    Shanghai’s local citizens. Based on discussions with the young expatriates
                    on the issue of “integration,” the chapter highlights how the youths
                    accept or even strengthen the exclusion of “China” from their
                    everyday spaces. It also shows how many of the expatriate youths experience
                    their physical difference as whites, and how this promotes a preference for
                    locations in Shanghai that are mainly occupied or frequented by whites. It then
                    demonstrates how the teenagers’ lack of interaction with Chinese youths
                    and the experience of special (and often preferential) treatment by Chinese
                    citizens lead to their feeling like “guests” in China.</p>
                <p>Part V, “Moving On,” first presents the “fateful moment”
                        (<xref rid="IDc216ae2a-4eaf-4b33-90e4-dcffee1bad76" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfe0dbb9b-f552-4f9d-b934-2a06e7ffabde">Giddens 1991,

                    festivities at a German school as a rite of passage (<xref rid="ID54e3710c-bc96-48eb-be09-5232a09196a8" ref-type="bibr" id="ID914e58be-a4f7-4e38-bf72-844840c7ae76">Van Gennep [1960] 1992</xref>)
                    that prepares the students for their farewell and the transition to new social
                    positions. The collective celebrations help the students to work through their
                    emotions about leaving—an amalgamation of sadness, anxiety, and
                    anticipation of what is to come. The last chapter summarizes the various facets
                    of privileged migration experienced by these young expatriates and offers
                    initial glimpses into their earliest experiences after leaving Shanghai.</p>
                <p>In a larger context, the youths’ perspectives on their own lives and the
                    experience of moving and living in expatriate communities that this ethnography
                    captures, aim to contribute to an understanding of the interdependence and
                    contradictions between the aspired flexibility of twenty-first century
                    identities and the rigidity of cultural divisions based on nationality,
                    ethnicity, gender, and class that are so apparent in our world.

      <p>This ethnography explores how expatriate teenagers in Shanghai experience high
        international mobility. It examines their moves into and out of the city with their
        families, their ways of life, and the ways they make sense of the many moves and places in
        their lives. This first part introduces who these expatriate teenagers are. I begin by
        summarizing the general situation and size of the expatriate communities in Shanghai and
        provide illustrative examples of the daily routines of international school life for
        expatriate youths. I then present two peer groups and their activities, before I zoom in on
        the individual experiences and viewpoints of four expatriate teenagers. Finally, I explain
        my methodological approaches and challenges accessing the social world of expatriate youths,
        as well as my overall position in the field.</p>

      <sec>
        <title>Chapter 1: Expatriates in Shanghai</title>
        <p>The youths in this ethnography—teenagers that I have talked to and spent time with
          over the last few years in Shanghai—form a very heterogeneous and privileged group
          of migrants. This study focuses primarily on students aged fifteen to eighteen, but
          includes participants as young as nine. Most of these students move every three to four
          years, whenever one of their parents is relocated. All my subjects came to Shanghai
          jointly with their families. These relocations were usually arranged and (financially)
          supported by their parents’ employers. </p>
        <p>The metropolis of Shanghai is in part shaped by such expatriate youths, along with
          foreign tourists, university students, and transnational professionals, as well as Chinese
          citizens returning from stays abroad; all these individuals comprise an Appaduraic
          ethnoscape (<xref id="ID621a9e20-afc2-4031-a8dc-df15c270b3a2" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID82c959e3-cc60-4345-929c-946dd331ef50">1996</xref>), where various cultural flows
          converge. As these different kinds of migrants bring and follow transnational capital and
          global enterprises to Shanghai, many of them become part of Shanghai’s heterogeneous
          international community. They shape, are integrated into, and identify with its spaces and
          the lifestyle and consumption habits associated with it. Shanghai, one of China’s
          most thriving cities, hosts a considerably large expatriate community. The Shanghai
          Statistical Bureau lists a total of 164,359 foreigners residing in Shanghai in <xref id="IDf683d181-08dc-48e8-86cf-d7992de5e521" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4e0e0629-86c3-46ad-89b9-c49e4ca4f759">2011</xref>, including 37,223
          Japanese, 16,805 American, and 8,040 German citizens (Shanghai Statistical Bureau 2013).
          According to sociologist James Farrer’s (<xref id="ID12f1b592-df7d-4c60-926c-7a6aee3207f0" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4e0e0629-86c3-46ad-89b9-c49e4ca4f759">2011</xref>) conversations with consulate
          and chamber of commerce officials in 2006, unofficial estimates are higher. He reckons
          that, in 2006, “70,000 to 100,000 Japanese, 20,000 to 30,000 Americans, and 12,000
          to 20,000 Germans were living in Shanghai on various types of visas” (<xref id="ID0435bda6-2015-481b-a81a-517930ca8bc5" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4e0e0629-86c3-46ad-89b9-c49e4ca4f759">Farrer 2011</xref>). </p>
        <p>This community commonly labels itself “expatriate,” a term that is derived
          from the Latin “ex patria” and refers to someone living outside their native
          country (<xref id="ID3164ab18-aced-4383-a2c2-3fed55b438ed" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDca81ec4c-7115-4859-9898-dde9176ec374">Coles and Fechter 2008, 5</xref>). The term
          is commonly shortened to expat. In Shanghai, it is used by human resource departments to
          describe employees who have been posted to Shanghai by their companies. It is also
          commonly used to refer to foreigners with a certain upper-class lifestyle. The actors of
          this study consider themselves part of this community and even label themselves as
          “expat children.” It is for this simple reason of self-ascription that I chose
          to work with the term “expatriates.” That “this term has itself become
          an identity referent with a set of shared meanings understood by those who adopt the
          label, manifest in particular practices such as socialising in certain areas” (<xref id="ID4909b2ef-a7df-4a52-8636-87ad95efb966" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDbb4223f7-83ce-425c-b3a8-377a2804f547">Butcher 2009, 1361</xref>), will become
          clear throughout this ethnography.</p>
        <p>The expatriate families under discussion all enjoy a privileged status. The
          parents’ postings to Shanghai are usually tied to high financial benefits and
          packages that include allowances for health insurance, travel costs, car leases, housing,
          and private international schools. It is difficult to pinpoint how many expatriate
          families come to Shanghai accompanied by under-aged children, as the Shanghai Statistical
          Bureau does not offer age-specific statistical data. However, just based on the student
          bodies from Shanghai’s thirteen largest international schools (each with multiple
          campuses and featuring curricula in English, French, or German), I estimate that at least
          16,500 students attended during the 2011–2012 academic year. Although the majority
          of these schools offer education beginning with kindergarten—sometimes even nursery
          school—there are many additional international kindergartens. The actual number of
          children and youths with foreign passports in Shanghai must therefore be even larger. The
          Shanghai municipal government does not allow Chinese nationals to enroll in international
          schools, thus all their students are of foreign nationality. </p>
        <p>Since school is a major part of each expatriate youth’s life, it was through these
          institutions that I first gained access to the actors of my study. Nevertheless, as the
          following chapters illustrate, ethnographic fieldwork is predominantly based on constant
          engagement, mutual understanding, and individuals’ willingness to trust the
          ethnographer and to share insights into their lives.</p>

        <p>It is six in the morning when the alarm goes off in my small, single-room apartment in
          downtown Shanghai. I get up and leave the aging high-rise close to busy Jiaojiabang road
          and hurry to the next metro stop. It is a cold and humid morning in February, the metro is
          still empty, and I am spared loud phone conversations and the throng of passengers. I exit
          somewhere in the city’s seemingly endless outskirts and try to catch a taxi. It is
          already eight when I finally arrive at my school. I am 28 years old and afraid of being
          late for class. </p>
        <p>I patiently wait at the entrance gate of the German and French School campus to receive a
          visitor’s pass from the Chinese guards. I am grateful that I am allowed to observe
          at the German School; most of the other international schools in Shanghai were not willing
          to open their doors to me. Wanting to work with minors brought several challenges: getting
          the permission of headmasters and teachers to visit classes and securing parents’
          consent to record interviews often seemed impossible. When a counselor and a teacher at
          two different American schools voiced interest in supporting my research and introduced my
          project to their principals, I hoped I could spend time with their students, but these
          schools rejected my research request on unknown grounds. Writing to school principals or
          parent associations directly also proved unsuccessful, except in the case of one British
          school. In November 2011, they collated a list of nine students who I was able to meet for
          group discussions on the school premises. At the same time, I repeatedly introduced myself
          to teachers, psychologists, and parents at events such as fairs or talks, and was able to
          visit a Singaporean international school to conduct some group interviews with students
          from the eleventh grade of their International Baccalaureate (IB) program. The group
          interviews I conducted at these two schools contributed valuable perspectives to this
          ethnography. However, I was reminded of anthropologist Ulf Hannerz’s description of
          “anthropology by appointment” where “access to people, to informants, is
          in fact often limited, regulated and timed” (</p>
        <p>The last students arrive and are entering the premises, opening the automatic doors with
          their student ID cards. I spot sixteen-year-old Charlie, a student from “my”
          class in the crowd, and it calms me to see a familiar face. I am not the only one running
          late. We wave at each other, I point to the desk officer at the front gate, and signal
          that I will be inside soon. She waits for me on the stairs and we hug to say hello.
          Charlie is the daughter of Chinese parents, but was born and grew up in Germany until her
          family moved to Shanghai when she was twelve years old. Chatting on our way to the
          classroom, she reminisces about the last time we saw each other at Mural, a night club,
          and asks me about my Chinese New Year break. She stayed at her Chinese grandmother’s
          place, which, according to her, was a bit boring, and then went to Sri Lanka. </p>
        <p>When we arrive at the classroom, just on time, I say hello to the teacher and drop onto a
          chair next to the sink, outside the U-shaped arrangement of tables where the students sit.
          The teacher says good morning, which has no effect whatsoever on the noise level, and
          welcomes me to his English class. Students are to work on group projects today and they
          freely mingle, talk, and laugh. They are between fifteen and eighteen and are one and a
          half years away from graduation. Grateful for being able to get to know them and meet them
          on a regular basis rather than at one-time interviews, I walk over to Karina and Lara
          (both new this school year) and say hello to Alex and Don (an inseparable duo) before
          taking a seat on the new couch, to simply listen to and watch what is going on around me.
          I say hello to Antonia—daughter of a Chinese-German marriage, Shanghai veteran, and
          my key contact over the last few weeks—who seems to be lost in thought, staring at a
          red piece of cardboard in front of her. I ask her about her group’s
          topic—Shakespeare on the Screen—and we start chatting. Two girls from the same
          group, Charlie—my partner in running late for class this morning—and Olivia,
          from Belgium, join in. Now everyone seems busy working on posters and presentations
          covering different topics about Shakespeare. Students are allowed to leave the classroom
          and there is a lot of movement. Meanwhile, someone has organized the “media
          cart” and every group takes out a computer to work on their handouts or to do
          research online. </p>
        <p>I go to the little snack bar in the piazza and get a coffee. Slowly walking back to the
          classroom across the long hallways and up the endless stairs, I realize how I have become
          accustomed to this place over the past weeks since I began visiting in December 2010. The
          silence in the building during class now seems friendlier and the contact with students
          has become easier.</p>
        <p>Back in the classroom, I look around and take some notes. As the popular website
          International Movie Data Base (IMDB) website is blocked in China and the school computers
          have no VPN or proxy installed to get around the virtual wall, Olivia is searching for
          another website listing numbers and information on Shakespeare film adaptations. We start
          to discuss Internet blocking in China, because blocking IMDB does not seem plausible to
          us. Olivia mentions the typical cases of Facebook and YouTube. Antonia states that she can
          understand the Chinese government hindering access to these. This discussion continues for
          a few minutes and I notice how, at times like this, the role of the Chinese state
          surrounding the German “bubble” in which these students live can suddenly
          become apparent. Eventually, the conversation changes topic and the girls focus on their
          poster, again. </p>
        <p>When a boy from the group working next to the girls looks over at their poster, his eyes
          squint to examine their heading. Olivia asks, with surprise in her voice: “Can you
          actually see anything? Your eyes are so narrow!”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e77">14</xref> Antonia jumps in: “Hey, are you dissing Chinese eyes?” Olivia
          responds: “No, I just find that fascinating.” Some mumbling goes on between
          the boy and his group. They ask Antonia to paint the headline for their poster and Antonia
          agrees to do so for 10 kuai. She walks over to their poster and I join, still somewhat
          lost in thought about the comment on the student’s eyes and the rigorous bashing of
          comments that might be conceived as racist. Do students draw boundaries based on the
          physical differences between “Asian” and “white” students? Olivia
          and Charlie leave the room shouting that we could find them in the empty senior classroom
          across the hall. When Antonia skilfully finishes writing the headline on the boys’
          poster, we join the two girls. </p>
        <p>The three teenagers sit on the couch and I seat myself on a chair. Charlie is finishing
          an apple, which she felt was inappropriate to eat in front of the teacher. I think about
          rules and the ways students’ behaviors are strictly regulated and immediately wonder
          if it is actually okay for me to drink coffee in class—as for instance the English
          teacher does. I struggle with my in-between position and, like other ethnographers working
          with youth (<xref id="IDb8f1af6f-6c28-4bcf-a734-102b02f8edc4" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe00bc9bf-d643-4bec-b159-3c189a0ff56b">Weißköppel 2001, 75</xref>),
          often find myself thrown back into my own adolescence. The school setting—an
          environment I have not revisited since my own graduation nine years
          prior—particularly evokes memories of my teenage years. The whole routine still
          feels strangely familiar. Listening to teachers’ explanations and student
          discussions, scribbling into my notebook, I often get lost in the classroom situation,
          even finding myself thinking “I hope (s)he doesn’t ask me!” This was of
          course never the case. My own inner transformation back into a high school student come to
          an abrupt halt when teachers ask me to contribute to teaching a lesson in Ethics class (at
          a German school), or in a Theory of Knowledge class (at a Singaporean school). In order to
          gain access to the classes, I do not object, and even use the opportunity to have students
          produce valuable research material such as mind maps (in their ethics class) or mental
          maps (a slightly different exercise, used in their geography class). Afterwards, teachers
          in the staff room where I occasionally go to take notes, talk about students’
          behavior and abilities, seeming wishing to draw me to “their side.” This
          in-betweenness of my situation is part of the reason why I have trouble positioning myself
          within the overall field. Being neither student nor teacher seems confusing not only to me
          but to the students as well. In contrast to Weißköppel, who during her research
          at a middle school in Germany (Realschule) rejected students’ offers to use the
          casual German “Du” in order to keep the age difference as a form of managing
          distance that to her felt necessary (<xref id="ID488b0519-06ad-4db3-9666-ffae13f439f8" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe00bc9bf-d643-4bec-b159-3c189a0ff56b">Weißköppel 2001,
            75</xref>), I decided to meet the students on the same level, or at least to the extent
          that this is possible in a research situation. I therefore offered my first name (and, in
          the German context, the informal “Du”) as a way of addressing me. However,
          while some students, like Antonia, relate to me on the same level from the beginning,
          others fall back to addressing me formally again and again. To me, it feels that their
          choice of address has become the battleground signifying my status and role, as well as
          the need to take time to establish trust, regardless of my offer of familiarity.</p>
        <p>While Charlie finishes her apple, I ask the girls about their weekend plans. Nothing so
          far, except a Star Wars night at Antonia’s for the weekend after. She knows the
          movies by heart and can almost talk along. They are planning to start at eight in the
          evening—after basketball practice—and watch until eight in the morning. A
          coffee machine and the promise of hitting each other should anyone fall asleep will help
          them stay up. Olivia thinks they also need “something fun” (was Lustiges),
          meaning hard alcohol. Antonia replies that this is impossible because her parents are
          home, but beer would be okay. Charlie and Olivia, however, do not like beer. Olivia looks
          disappointed. Charlie says that “you don’t always need alcohol.” Other
          students start coming into the room as the next class is about to begin, so we get up and
          return to our own classroom. </p>
        <p>I sit down again and scribble into my notebook. “A lot of Anglicisms,” I
          write. “Does this have something to do with Shakespeare and being in an English
          class? Or is it a general phenomenon among German expat kids?” Meanwhile, one
          student has opened his Flickr account. He and Olivia discuss a commentary someone wrote
          beneath a picture of Olivia’s boyfriend. The question seems to be centered on
          determining who wrote that commentary, but I cannot really follow their discussion, due to
          my lack of familiarity with Flickr. When Olivia returns to her group to work on the
          presentation, I join in discussing their topic and ask them whether they have considered
          speaking about general difficulties when adapting theater plays for the screen. They have
          not, and Olivia immediately starts to google it. Trying to restrain myself from getting
          too involved, I turn to writing in my notebook and watching them work on their
          presentation. </p>
        <p>Class is over. I am still not used to the absence of a school bell that was so prominent
          in my own school life. Students are shouting, “Are we eating at the
            shop?”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e97">15</xref> I walk over to talk to Kressi
          and Mia. Mia inquires about my dissertation and I tell her that I am working on the
          overall structure, and explain the different chapters and parts to her. Mia poses
          questions and comments about my work and is keen to read my ethnography once it is
          finished or published, or even before, which leads to questions of representation,
          anonymity, and the consequences of my texts. Thus my ethnographic research practices,
          reflections, and writing have become part of the teenage students’ daily lives. In
          other words, in a conversation such as the one I have with Mia, the practice of writing is
          embedded in its larger context. This conversation is just one example of how research is a
          practice, an engagement with the youths, as Massey concisely describes:</p>
        <p> <disp-quote id="dispquote11">
          <p>Here what we might have called representation is no longer a process of fixing, but an
          element in a continuous production; a part of it all, and itself constantly becoming. This
          is a position which rejects a strict separation between world and text and which
          understands scientific activity as being just that—an activity, a practice, an
          embedded engagement in the world of which it is a part. Not representation but
          experimentation (<xref id="ID1e04001c-dd98-4abc-85f8-9c9ba94da195" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDf6826a36-f34c-4f5a-b534-f907f5aaf7ae">2005, 28</xref>). </p>

      <p>No one who writes about real people in real life can ignore the fact that words may have
          consequences for the people they write about—and alter their images of Self,
          labeling by others, their relationships, or the politics structuring their everyday
          practices. Caroline Brettell and other anthropologists (<xref id="ID4019d142-b2b2-49c4-a086-0dd9062457be" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0e2b0f81-9e4d-4078-9e91-4deb51a9feb7">1993</xref>) address this issue and ask
          what happens when they read what we write. What are the consequences for the researched,
          the ethnographer, the relationship between them, and for the writing itself? While this
          question was unknown to early ethnographers whose language of writing often differed from
          those whom they studied (Brettell <xref id="IDdc7c25f8-5d9a-47ba-a24b-3e7677d730e8" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0e2b0f81-9e4d-4078-9e91-4deb51a9feb7">1993</xref>), it certainly
          causes me great concern and prompts serious contemplation. The problem of securing
          anonymity troubles me in particular and proves difficult in regards to maintaining my own
          scientific standards when describing specific locations and practices. While many students
          were eager to appear in “the book” with their real names, we agreed that they
          themselves should choose their own code names, which at least render them anonymous to
          outsiders. This, however, does not secure complete anonymity. My research focus on urban
          sensory experiences requires detailed descriptions of places that make schools and
          locations traceable for the informed reader. As in my conversation with Mia, I repeatedly
          discuss these issues with the students themselves. I also address it in conversations with
          teachers and principals, and the community ultimately agrees to accept the potential
          ramifications. I face a greater moral dilemma when it comes to the fact that the students
          on whom my work focuses almost all know each other and no degree of
          anonymizing—unless I enter the realm of the fictitious—can ensure that they
          will not recognize their peers. Consequently, I very carefully omit all hostile or
          derogatory remarks that the teenagers make against their peers. Hostilities exist, but are
          not crucial to my work. </p>
        <p>Daniel Goldstein (<xref id="ID330afe9a-b2fb-498b-a404-779f340d201f" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID8a574126-0e08-4915-8fee-c5054a5a238b">2002</xref>) comments on the impact of the
          ethnographer’s presence as that of a future author in the field, describing how his
          informants in the Andes in Bolivia were continuously concerned about “the
          book” he would write. Goldstein argues that one can see ethnographic writing in a
          positive light, as a form of indigenous media, or a means of self-representation. </p>

          <p>Even in more ordinary sorts of fieldwork contexts, in which the final product of the

          to establish control over the ways in which they will be represented by the ethnographer

          mistrust, because they feared his writings might highlight aspects that could endanger
          their initiatives.</p>
        <p>While the teenagers in Shanghai are aware that my work will bring them no financial

        <p>Mia and I change the topic and talk about a Karl Lagerfeld Photography exhibition that I
          went to see with a Chinese friend of mine. I know that Mia and Kressi are interested in
          photography and fashion. Unfortunately, I do not recall the exact address of the gallery
          at the Bund but I promise to look it up for them. Then I return to Karina and Lara. Lara
          (who is busy kissing her boyfriend) and Karina agree to meet me for an interview the
          following week. We exchange email addresses and phone numbers. Karina seems very
          interested, Lara a bit unmotivated. I exit the classroom and bump into Andrea, whom I met
          two weeks ago on a Friday night at Mural. We discuss my dissertation project and she is
          curious about the differences I found between students at her school and those at others
          schools in Shanghai. Andrea is interested in giving an interview and we arrange to meet at
          a café downtown in the next few days. At this moment, I see the door of
          “my” classroom shutting, quickly say goodbye, and silently sneak inside. </p>
        <p>In German class, I confirm with the teacher that I may join his class today. He agrees
          and officially starts class by addressing the upcoming exams. The students lament as usual
          and then open their books. Communication analysis has already been on the lesson plan for
          a couple of periods. Today, we read a text on kissing. One student reads the whole article
          out loud. It addresses the famous study by Margaret Mead that explored the interaction
          between American service men and local residents in wartime Britain, focusing on the issue
          of kissing and the different meanings attributed to a kiss. The textbook explains that,
          while Americans kiss early in romantic relationships, a kiss came at a much later stage
          for British women in the 1940s. The students all seem very interested in the topic and the
          teacher encourages them to apply Watzlawick’s communication analysis in order to
          explain. But first he asks: “How do you flirt today?” As the text had
          explained that kissing was, according to Mead, only step twenty-five for British women,
          the girls sitting close to me count: “eye contact,” “smiling,”
          “talking,” “having a drink,” “exchanging phone
          numbers,” “adding on Facebook,” “first text message,” and
          “the first date.” Bjorn, who has only been in Shanghai for half a year, jumps
          in and, seemingly agitated, shouts: “No! First date? That’s only because they
          make such a big deal out of it in movies!” Other boys join in. The girls protest:
          “If it is important to you, you put an effort into that first date!” Alex
          comments critically on the romantic ideal of love at first sight and how this draws girls
          to the cinema. The teacher draws from some of the remarks and asks: “If we watch
          movies from other cultures, is that similar? How about movies from India or China?”
          The class discusses and Antonia describes a Chinese movie that typically ends with the
          first kiss in the last scene. Everybody in class now seems to talk simultaneously and I
          can hardly follow, let alone take notes on all the comments. Antonia, agitatedly, voices
          how you cannot just end a relationship after two months in China. “You are
          immediately considered a slut!” The class reacts by shouting “What?”
          Some students contradict her. “Okay, that’s how it is in my family,”
          Antonia adds, indirectly referring to her latest break-up. The teacher draws the attention
          back to the text and the corresponding exercises in the book: “Education, cultural
          differences, what else is there in that text?” Students comment on the different
          roles and role relationships, historical developments in the US and Britain, and the
          subconscious in Watzlawick’s theory. When the teacher asks them to take into
          consideration that some cultures might be even more different than the US and England, one
          student brings up the example of sex before marriage: “This can get really
          serious.” The teacher follows up and starts talking about honor killings, which
          according to him happen when girls adapt but their families stick to their traditions from
          home. I find this example clichéd, but stay in my role as the silent observer. A few
          students remark on how this example is particularly extreme. The teacher agrees, but holds
          to his opinion that “cultural conflict can lead to death.” By now, I have
          learned that teachers use such exaggerations and provocations to trigger discussions. We
          move on to the next textbook exercise. The teacher uses his drama skills to underline the
          idea of roles and role expectations. He gives the example of a manager who seems unable to
          leave his manager role behind when he gets home. The students analyze that this father
          obviously does not realize how he is trapped in his role and that his family has a
          different role expectation. The students start thinking about what to do in such a case.
          Olivia suggests clearly stating: “Listen to me.” Another student proposes to
          “write a letter saying ‘Call me when you understand’ and then
          leave.” Olivia finds that this drastic measure should only be used when other means
          have failed. Xia proposes sending the father on a holiday. Kressi suggests clearly stating
          that “your family isn’t your office.”</p>
        <p>It seems as if the students can identify perfectly with the scenario they are discussing
          and I wonder about the manager parents in their lives. Most of the forty-three
          international school students I interviewed have parents employed by foreign companies.
          Usually, the father’s career was the primary motive behind the move to Shanghai.
          While all their fathers are employed, only some of the mothers work, and mostly do so
          part-time. Their father’s jobs range from logistics to the automobile industry,
          while one father works as a manager for an international hotel chain and another at a
          university. </p>
        <p>Class is almost over and the teacher wraps up the discussions on Watzlawick and his
          communication theory by pointing out that the meta-level is the key. How right he is. The
          meta-level is often present in my conversations and interviews with expatriate youths.
          Their perspectives continually impress me. It is their self-reflective voices that form
          the heart of this study. In particular, the members of two peers groups from the German
          school that I was able to spend time with, thanks to Antonia and Bjorn, provided insights
          into expatriate youths’ lives beyond school and their reflections upon these
          aspects.</p>

        <p>Joining the teenagers outside the realm of school, in particular during their nightlife
          activities, proved tremendously valuable in helping me to establish my position among
          them. These occasions helped me to contextualize the students’ verbalized
          reflections upon their lives and to grasp their experiences and understandings of
          mobility, being young, and belonging to the expatriate community. These opportunities also
          made it possible for me to prove that I could be trusted.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e147">17</xref> While teachers actively try to avoid such situations by making
          sure they do not frequent the same clubs or bars, my role and participation in activities
          gradually became accepted after months of engaging with the teenagers outside of school
          and sharing my own story with them.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e154">18</xref> This
          constant negotiation of my role and proximity in the beginning, along with later finding
          myself placed, at least temporarily, within the group, seem typical for ethnographic work.
          I was happy and comfortable taking on the role of an older sister who reports from
          university life in Germany, as this turned out to be the aspect of my life everyone was
          most interested in. While the practice of listening closely is the most important part of
          any ethnographic project, I also experienced that sharing is vital to overcoming
          hierarchies and the distance that hinder the ethnographer who wants to capture
          youths’ own perspectives and voices.</p>
        <p>In line with these fieldwork practices, I chose a relational approach that acknowledged
          the ties between me and the youths I researched, and the influence of those ties on
          matters of access as well as on my perspective.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e163">19</xref> While Shanghai as the research site and expatriate teenagers as the main
          actors of my study had been set from the start, the paths I followed to understand their
          lives were often improvised. Coleman and Collins (<xref id="IDecd1f76d-17a4-47bf-a1a4-d1babbe48f39" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDb91b887f-3456-412e-962b-574a1718b738">2006</xref>) highlight the role the
          researcher’s choice of focus plays, arguing that “fields are as much
          ‘performed’ as ‘discovered,’ framed by boundaries that shift
          according to the analytical and rhetorical preferences of the ethnographer and, more
          rarely, the informant” (<xref id="ID011051fd-65ad-44af-a1fd-348cbf245e9b" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDb91b887f-3456-412e-962b-574a1718b738">Coleman and Collins 2006,
            17</xref>). Thus my “field,” my point of view on expatriate youths and the
          accounts I gathered, was influenced by my own stance, perspective, and abilities.
          Additionally, different gatekeepers played a crucial role in my navigation in the field,
          allowing or restricting access to certain sites, events, or people. It is my keen interest
          in students who actively explore Shanghai on their own, as well as certain key
          facilitators like Antonia, that finally led me to focus on and spend time with two peer
          groups in particular. These two groups consisted of one all-girls group and one all-boys
            group.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e170">20</xref>

          <title>3.1 Fieldwork with “the girls:” real ambitions and fake
            Louboutins</title>
          <p>“The girls” are Antonia, Mia, Kressi, Charlie, Olivia, and Andrea. They
            were between fifteen and seventeen years old when I first met them at school. Antonia in
            particular played a vital role in my interactions with them, as it was her invitation to
            join nightlife activities that lead to my forming closer contacts with the rest of the
            group and many others at the German school. The way she included me and openly stated
            “Marie is one of us” provided essential opportunities for my work. Antonia,
            child of a Chinese-German marriage, was born in Germany, but grew up in Shanghai and has
            been going to the same school all her life—this is rare among expatriate children.
            She is a determined, smart young woman, who has high expectations for herself and highly
            values intelligence and analytical minds. Other students sometimes seem to find her
            active and passionate participation in discussions in the classroom annoying. Antonia
            and I have gotten along well from the beginning and, with her generous, independent, and
            opinionated ways, she forms a key figure in my research. Mia, an ambitious and eloquent
            girl, and her artistic friend Kressi, are the youngest members of the group because they
            have both skipped a grade. They are new to the class and at first not allowed to go out
            as often as the others. Over the course of the school year, however, they do become
            permanent members of the group. Mia has a typical expat biography and has moved several
            times in her life. Kressi, in contrast, moved to Shanghai at an early age. She was born
            in Germany to Vietnamese parents with Cantonese roots and seems to have family all over
            the world. Charlie, born in Germany to Chinese parents and very much liked by everyone
            at school due to her friendly ways, and Olivia from Belgium, admired for her beauty,
            arrange and participate in group activities on a regular basis. Andrea, the only one of
            the girls attending another class, is one of the few students who lives downtown. Andrea
            is a quirky, creative student who likes to make people laugh and has a particular
            reputation for partying—especially dancing—Shanghai’s nights away with
            Antonia. </p>
          <p>I am lucky to have met this group and am happy to accompany them to various activities.
            When, for instance, in the beginning of May, the geography teacher invites me to join
            his class for an excursion, I arrange with “the girls” (without Charlie, who
            is in a different class) to join their group. The students are supposed to do photo
            walks through different parts of Shanghai to document elements of globalization. I meet
            the teacher and students at 3 p.m. at school. Andrea, Antonia, and Mia greet me when I
            arrive just on time and inform me that we will pick up Kressi and Olivia at home on our
            way downtown. However, one group only consists of two students and the teacher asks me
            to join them, as there has to be a minimum of three in each group for safety reasons.
            The girls protest. Luckily, another student shows up and I can stay in “my”
            group. Antonia’s driver is waiting outside to take us. The girls have chosen the
            area of Tianzifang, a block of old Shanghainese lane houses that have been turned into
            small shops, cafés, and restaurants. I am glad to hang out with the girls who I
            know best, particularly as I had had a rough night due to food poisoning. I am also glad
            to join in on some expatriate luxury and hop into the big, air-conditioned van instead
            of the crowded metro. </p>
          <p>We drive to two different compounds to pick up Olivia and Kressi. Although I had been
            to several expatriate family homes for my research on “trailing spouses” in
            2007, it is the first time I really see how these two students live. Big villas
            surrounded by green spaces and high walls. The girls, who are naturally not startled by
            their friends’ houses, discuss Olivia’s romantic situation. Somehow, maybe
            due to my presence, the discussion shifts all of a sudden to foreign languages and
            language proficiency. Antonia shares a story from the last MUN (Model United
              Nations)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e191">21</xref> conference, where she met a
            Korean girl who grew up in Germany and England. This girl had offered to speak German
            with Antonia, in case English was too difficult for her. Remembering this girl’s
            comment, Antonia becomes furious and all the girls join in. Everybody sees this remark
            as extremely insulting. This protest is not only a form of friendly support but is also
            justified, as Antonia’s English is quite flawless. However, sitting among them on
            the back seat of the van, I silently consider how the Korean girl’s comment also
            indirectly implies that they lack certain cosmopolitan competencies, thus calling for
            communal critique. Andrea’s quick-witted input is requested and she contemplates
            aloud what the right response to such an insulting and deprecatory remark might be. We
            further discuss the topic of language skills and everyone shares stories about children
            in their community who grew up bilingually. Olivia, who speaks Flemish at home, tells us
            that she only learned German in fifth grade. Antonia feels she speaks neither German nor
            Chinese very well. Andrea shares how she gave up studying Chinese, to be immediately
            criticized by Antonia for it. One should expect that, after so many years in Shanghai,
            they should be able to speak Chinese, Antonia declares, but that they cannot because
            they are content to “live in the expat bubble.” I notice that the bubble
            metaphor seems omnipresent among expatriates in Shanghai—Paul, for instance, whose
            story I told in the introduction, also used it. I wonder if my presence triggers such
            remarks. Andrea talks about the difficulties of learning Chinese. I share that, although
            I have taken numerous evening classes in Chinese and just resumed taking lessons a few
            weeks ago, I myself am also far from going beyond simple everyday topics. </p>
          <p>The girls plan a Lord of the Rings night and discuss what kind of (German) candies
            their parents should buy. Antonia says that in no way could she send her mom shopping.
            She has no time for that, between owning three companies and never sleeping for more
            than five hours a night. Even her dad, who is a general manager, has more time. I
            silently guess that their ayi does all the grocery shopping.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e206">22</xref> Upon asking about a classmate of theirs, I accidently trigger
            several stories about different students and couples and feel like a whole world of
            gossip opens up. Who is wearing inappropriate clothes or has ended relationships in
            inappropriate ways, who is simply using girls, who is surprisingly getting along with
            whom, and who is “setting back emancipation for at least 200 years,” among
            other topics, arise. In between all this gossip, the subject of conversation turns to me
            and my boyfriend, whom they met at a concert, and my former relationships and why they
            ended. Fieldwork means sharing. This gossip about acquaintances and first romances, as
            well as school grades, language skills, and career ambitions is common among the girls.
            On the one hand, the moral implications of listening or even participating in gossip
            demanded constant reflection about my role and obligations as a researcher and remained
            difficult for me throughout my fieldwork. On the other hand, gossip was an important
            element that enabled me to gain information about the students’ daily
            lives—see Marie Gillespie's (<xref id="ID61d7e5b9-eb89-4a2b-b021-08b872e1f477" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0006d938-1957-4df3-a7a4-8860a8545334">1999</xref>) work on how
            gossip about soap operas among South Asian youth in London is linked to negotiating
            their own social networks—as well as to maintain the ongoing process of social
            access (<xref id="IDb21a2617-8cf1-483e-ae16-c073185451b3" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID53d53653-ccd5-41dd-aafb-fc78aca2236d">Carmel 2011, 552</xref>). </p>
          <p>After all the gossip, Andrea laughs and wonders what I must be writing about them. I
            sigh and tell them that I honestly do not know and that I sometimes feel they could
            write it better themselves. They protest and encourage me. While I am often tremendously
            worried about my research subjects reading my writing, this is one of the rewarding
            moments of working with students who are truly interested in and supportive of my work. </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the interaction with the Chinese driver employed by Antonia’s family
            is limited to navigating him to the right compounds and the girls’ houses. He is
            apparently presumed to know the way to the Tianzifang complex. When, almost an hour
            later, he shouts “Dao le!” (“We’re here!”), all of the
            girls cry out that this cannot be true. We note that we ended up in Taicang Road instead
            of Taikang Road. The driver, without commenting and apparently used to hectic shouting
            and complaints—maybe even to foreigners’ mispronunciations of Chinese street
            names—drives on and brings us to the desired destination. I get out last and am
            the only one to say goodbye to the driver. Antonia apologizes to everyone for her driver
            bringing us to the wrong location at first. No one seems to notice.</p>
          <p>When we arrive, we head towards a café known for its delicious milkshakes, called
            Kommune, which offers outdoor seating in the midst of small alleys and, like all coffee
            shops in Tianzifang, has prices for an expat income rather than the average
            Shanghainese. Here, a milkshake costs around RMB 38 (€4.18).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e225">23</xref> On the way there, Mia, Kressi, and Olivia take photos. I
            take photos of them taking photos, but as we all have a research agenda today, it feels
            okay. Drinking milkshakes, chatting, and taking pictures keeps us entertained for a
            while. Mia and Kressi buy some of the cafe’s well-designed drinking glasses for
            their own rooms. We then leave to explore the area further with our cameras. We look at
            a stall offering earrings and Olivia, who always wears big earrings, buys a pair. We
            then stop at a piercing and tattoo studio.</p>
          <p>Antonia flips through a folder full of tattoo images. She already has a small tattoo on
            her neck and is now looking for a nice image of a salamander for a second tattoo. She
            remembers how she discovered the best image so far at a place close to Olivia’s
            home in Belgium. She does not find one she likes in this studio’s catalogue, but
            shares that it is probably wiser to wait until she turns eighteen anyway, so that her
            parents cannot object. The girls discuss the ideal placement of tattoos and Andrea
            shares that her aunt in Germany runs a tattoo studio, stressing that she does not do the
            tattoos herself, anymore, but that she manages the store. I note that it seems important
            to stress her aunt’s higher position in the business. We pass a store with ethnic
            clothing that I like and, in the next store, I spot a pair of trousers. Mia then takes a
            photo of them so I can eventually get a pair made in the same style, as this pair is too
            expensive for me. We stroll along the lanes, window-shopping, enjoying the shared
            practices of “doing fashion” (<xref id="ID1c9c7c72-1a77-4821-a014-3bde602629dc" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDdc3ed0eb-469a-4963-80e6-d1c64174811c">Liechty 2003</xref>); buying, trying on,
            or talking about clothes. These topics are familiar to me and I easily join their
            conversations. </p>
          <p>All the while, the students take pictures for the photo documentation project on
            globalization. Their research project allows me to feel comfortable with my own research
            agenda. This is not the norm. Being with them sometimes feels a lot like being with
            friends, while at other moments my academic agenda becomes central again and my role
            shifts. One night, for example, when we were cooking together at Kressi’s house
            and getting ready to go to a club downtown, I felt very much like a part of the group.
            Then the girls started to discuss outfits and Olivia mentioned her Louboutins
            (infamously high-heeled designer shoes) and everything changed. My facial expression
            must have revealed my inner surprise at her having such expensive stilettos at the age
            of sixteen. Antonia asked what I was thinking about and whether I had found something to
            write about. I felt a little embarrassed, as I was discovered again as the researcher,
            but then admitted what had shocked me. Revealing my thoughts, the girls all started
            laughing, leaving me confused for a moment until they all shouted that these shoes were
            of course only copies from one of Shanghai’s many “fake markets.” I
            realized, in that moment, that my shifting from friend to researcher, though not easy
            for me, was okay with “the girls.” They always met my research project with
            interest and continuously asked me about my latest writings, findings, and ideas. While
            certain intimate topics gave me the feeling of having passed a threshold towards trust
            and acceptance, other topics were obviously triggered by my mere presence and research
            questions. The discussions about language skills, nationalities, and the
            “expatriate bubble” on the way to Tianzifang, for instance, are in strong
            relation to my research themes as the girls understand them. Nonetheless, these topics
            do not seem new to them, but seem to have been discussed many times before. Thus it is
            often the apparent routineness of certain conversational themes that leads me to
            conclude that these issues are important to them. </p>
          <p>We step into a small shop selling knickknacks and Olivia starts talking about her
            situation with her ex-boyfriend who is leaving Shanghai. They have just separated and
            the girls wonder if she should still give him the present she has prepared for
            him—a slideshow with pictures of their time in Shanghai, accompanied by
            “their” songs. The girls suggest she should simply ask him if he still wants
            it. I silently think about the difficulties of first romantic relationships that are
            constantly in danger of being torn apart by parental decisions to move on. The girls, on
            the contrary, seem quite pragmatic.</p>
          <p>We move on, stroll through a boutique selling leather bags, and another offering all
            kinds of hats. Finally, we all sit down on the pavement, exhausted from all the
            impressions surrounding us. I take a few pictures. The girls talk about their prom next
            year and their ideas for a talent night that they want to propose for the next term. We
            then hop into a cab to meet the rest of their class and the teacher for dinner, a
            discussion of the excursion, and the exchange of photos at an American diner.</p>

          <title>3.2 Fieldwork with “the boys:” repulsive moments and aesthetic
            jellyfish</title>
          <p>In the beginning, the all-boys group included Bjorn, Alex, Peter, Don, Marco, and
            Giovanni. They were later joined by Bjorn’s brother and two students from the
            grade below. When I first interacted with them at school, I was, for some reason, a
            little bit intimidated, particularly by Alex, who is the oldest in class and who I had
            seen become angry at a fellow student. However, during the first interview with him,
            Bjorn, and Don, I find them all to be quite nice and eager to share their viewpoints.
            They are smoking heavily during the interview and particularly like to showcase their
            nightlife experiences. Alex, even until the end of my fieldwork stay, sometimes
            accidently uses the German polite form “Sie” to address me and our
            relationship remains distant, albeit friendly. Although I have never conducted a
            follow-up interview with Don, I have had several casual conversations with him. Bjorn
            and I have become closer over the months, mainly through sharing music, since we both
            like the same reggae artists. I conduct two individual follow-up interviews with him.
            The beginning of my relationship with Peter and Marco is different. We talk outside of
            school, at the club Mural, before I hold their initial interviews. These two boys are in
            a different class from the one I regularly visit. Besides a long first interview with
            the two of them, I conduct a follow-up interview with Peter alone in June 2012.
            Giovanni, although we have interacted before, is first interviewed during my short stay
            in September 2011 and again in June 2012. All the boys are self-reflective and
            interesting to talk to. They classify themselves as the peer group that goes out,
            drinks, consumes cannabis, feels that school is not the most important thing in life,
            and highly values people who are equally cool, relaxed, or—as they put
            it—“chilled.” </p>
          <p>These two groups I accompany, who label each other as “the boys” or
            “the girls” respectively, sometimes unite their nightlife activities.
            Occasionally exploring the boys’ nightlife activities in the spring of 2011,
            without “the girls” with whom I have already built a stronger relationship,
            feels strange at first. Nonetheless, I soon enjoy accompanying “the boys” to
            the club Mural on Friday nights. Over weeks of joining them at school, sharing dinner,
            partying, and discussing their lives with them, I feel increasingly comfortable around
            them and find their company and outlook on life enjoyable. But just when I get to this
            point of ease in our interaction, we come to the last time I go out with them before I
            have to leave Shanghai in July 2011. The school year has ended.</p>
          <p>That summer night in July, the boys and girls at first hang out together at Mural,
            before the girls move on to a different club. I decide to stay behind with the boys and
            step outside to get some air and to see what is going on. The boys discuss going to
            another club called Shelter. But standing outside, talking about music, location, and
            the like, everyone seems to be waiting for something. Listening to the ongoing
            conversations, I begin to understand that a decision about the next location cannot be
            made without Alex, who has disappeared with a Chinese girl in the back alley.
            Bjorn’s brother, who joined the group recently, goes back and keeps some of the
            boys up to date on what is going on. I start feeling uncomfortable and I am unsure of
            how to behave. Are the boys bragging or joking? What is really happening back there?
            While I am trying to figure out my own position on the matter, an extremely drunk
            Chinese girl appears on the scene. Staggering on her high heels she finally opts to sit
            down on the stairs. I watch her as she leans back against Matthias who has come along
            this night and happened to sit on the stairs. Matthias, who used to be in a band with
            Paul—whose story I told in the introduction—and who has been extremely
            helpful by introducing me to students from other schools, only entered the 11th grade
            recently. The Chinese girl leaning back against Matthias provokes much amusement among
            the group. The boys joke and tease Matthias. The funny conversation and light amusement,
            however, suddenly change when one of the boys suggests peeing on the girl. Thinking this
            is a joke, I am startled when the others join in the conversation by suggesting
            different angles from which to undertake this disgusting and humiliating act. Shocked at
            this behavior by the boys whom I considered to be so mature, I intervene and openly
            state that I am disgusted by the idea and that I will not allow it to happen. I leave to
            get water and coke for everyone, telling them that they apparently need to sober up.
            While giving a bottle of water to the Chinese girl, I start talking to her. I try to
            learn her address and maneuver her toward a cab. She vomits. I then put her into a taxi
            and give the driver her address. Bjorn tells me off: I ruined all the fun, he says. I
            should stop acting like a social worker and will not be allowed to cite his interviews
            any longer. I know that, for the first time, I am stretching my boundaries from
            participating to interrupting.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e257">24</xref> I try to
            stay calm and stick to my opinion. He finally asks me for a sip from my drink, which I
            offer him jokingly, under the condition that he lets me cite his interviews, again. He
            agrees; crisis averted. When Alex appears back on the scene, everyone applauds, I am too
            tired or too cowardly to try to figure out what actually happened and the whole group
            moves on to Shelter, another club. Some of the boys purchase marijuana at a street
            barbecue stall and we sit outside, waiting for the club to stop charging at 3 a.m. After
            dancing only for a bit, I soon leave for my apartment, still shocked to have seen such a
            different side of the boys. Is this typical “adolescent” behavior, I wonder?
            Is this the infamous “peer pressure?” What, if anything, does all of this
            have to do with racism? Do we have to understand such behavior or fantasies in the light
            of performances of masculinity? </p>
          <p>Soon afterward, I pack these ambivalent thoughts along with all my belongings and leave
            for Germany. When I return to Shanghai for follow-up visits in September 2011 and June
            2012, I have great discussions with all of the boys, again. However, the experience of
            that night remains in the forefront on my mind. During my last follow-up visit,
            graduation is immanent and everyone is reminiscing about the good times they have had in
            Shanghai. The troublesome night at Mural and Shelter comes up, too. Stories of other
            nights follow, about Marco falling asleep and the other boys forgetting him in front of
            a club, where he later woke up minus his phone and cash. Laughter accompanies these
            stories. Another anecdote is shared about how someone else fell asleep and one of them
            stuck his penis in the sleeper’s ear. Laughter again. I am startled again by the
            combination of tight friendships and, at the same time, brutal practices of teasing,
            mobbing, and physical harassment. I become particularly interested in these more brutal
            aspects and hierarchies during this last stay in the summer of 2012.</p>
          <p>“The boys” regularly meet at Alex’s place. “The girls”
            are not allowed to come to these gatherings and even Kressi, who has since become
            Bjorn’s girlfriend, has called these regular gatherings “exclusive,”
            so I think it impossible to join. After an interview with Peter, however, he offers to
            contact Alex, Bjorn, and Don to ask when they have time to record another interview.
            While downtown for an interview with Andrea, Peter texts me, saying I should join the
            other boys at an Indian restaurant in the outskirts of the city and conduct the
            interview there. However, it is almost an hour drive and it is impossible for me to make
            it on time. After texting back and forth, we agree that Peter and I will join them
            later, at Alex’s parents’ house. I am excited to join them at last for their
            ritual boys’ evening. </p>
          <p>At 10 p.m. I am waiting for Peter in front of a Lianhua supermarket close to the
            compound gate. He calls and arranges for Bjorn’s brother to pick me up on his
            scooter. He pulls up a few minutes later, I jump on, and we ride through the dark,
            through the shiny new and empty lanes of the compound, passing well-trimmed lawns and
            big villas. Mid-way I spot Peter, headphones on, cycling on his bike. After several
            turns, left and right, we arrive. I jump off and open the gate for the boys to drive
            inside. </p>
          <p>I follow Peter and Bjorn’s brother into the house via the terrace, through the
            huge living room, and upstairs, into Alex’s room. Here, about ten boys are lying
            and sitting on the couch and the big bed, smoking, drinking beer, and watching a movie.
            A dog greets me and, in my insecure situation, not knowing what to do, I focus on the
            dog and start to pet it. The TV screen shows sharks tearing something or someone apart.
            Cuddling the dog to keep my eyes away from the screen, I panic at the thought of being
            stuck watching a horror movie with a bunch of drunken and stoned teenage boys. Trying to
            calm myself—how grateful I am to the dog!—I soon realize, to my surprise,
            that we are only watching </p>
          <p>Some of the guys step out onto the adjacent balcony to smoke marijuana and I get a spot
            on the couch between one of Antonia’s friends—a former student at the school
            but, like me, a temporary guest of the group—and Giovanni. Antonia's friend
            curiously asks me why I am here or, as he rephrases it, who I came with. Simply
            shrugging my shoulders and mumbling something about my interview, I realize that my
            academic intention does not answer the question. Hardly any girls are allowed to join
            these gatherings and not all boys, either. When I then respond that Peter invited me,
            everything seems clear. No further questions asked. Peter, as I later found out in
            discussions with Bjorn and also some of the girls, is thought to be one of the heads of
            the group. He can therefore invite anyone, even me. I open a beer and try to grasp the
            overall mood. I realize that the interview is a stupid idea that night and decide that
            witnessing what is going on is more important than interrupting their “boys’
            night” rituals. I am startled at how relaxed (or perhaps stoned) everyone is, and
            how nicely they behave. Instead of the expected roughness and meanness, I find the boys
            lying next to each other on the bed, leaning against each other, almost hugging,
            watching a beautiful movie, and making loud remarks on the aesthetics of water plants
            and jellyfish. When the movie abruptly stops because only the first part has been
            downloaded, the boys want to put music on. Bjorn, Don, and Peter are calling for
            Antonín Dvořák’s 9th symphony. The music is played at a high volume
            and everyone is asked to be quiet. Peter lies flat on his stomach on the bed with his
            head reaching over the end, nodding along with the rhythm. Bjorn moves his arms in a
            conductor’s manner. It is a beautiful sight: ten rough boys, lying around humming
            along with the melodies of Dvořák’s “From the New World.”
            They had discussed this piece for months in music class and now seem to love it. Alex
            expresses how he finds the oboe a beautiful instrument. An oboe solo, extremely moving
            indeed, has preceded his remark. After the symphony ends, two boys get ready to go get
            food from KFC.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2872">25</xref> The way in which Peter and
            Bjorn give them their orders allows the hierarchies to still shine through a little. We
            start to watch the movie The Naked Gun 2½. Bjorn laughs loudly at every joke. We
            stop the movie for some reason. The boys return with the food and some boys leave. A few
            of them have to go to school the next day. Giovanni also leaves. Peter enjoys his
            chicken wings. Don only talks about the news of the “Abistreich”
            cancellation (he received an email on his smart phone).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e297">26</xref> We watch a little more of The Naked Gun 2½. Peter and
            Don want to leave, so I opt to join them and we share a cab. I chip in 20 RMB, and they
            drop me off in front of the guesthouse that I am staying in.</p>
          <p>I enjoy “the boys’’’ company and their outlook on life, and am
            particularly intrigued by their ways because their behavior and relationships toward
            each other are less familiar to me than those of “the girls.” At the same
            time, the group dynamics and their behavior trouble me and I am uncertain about what is
            performed for me and what is really going on in their lives. As I get to know them
            individually, however, I become more and more familiar and less intimidated by their
            ways as a group. At the same time, the moments spent with the group help me to better
            understand the gendered experiences of being an expat teen in Shanghai, as well as to
            follow their individual stories.</p>
          <p>The next chapter focuses on these personal stories and introduces four individuals: two
            of them, Antonia and Bjorn, as my primary contacts for “the girls” and
            “the boys,” Arnaud, as someone from a different school, and finally Xia, as
            someone who is less involved in activities outside of school.</p>

          <disp-quote id="dispquote14"> <p>Cultural identities are the points of identification, the unstable points of
          identification or suture, which are made, within the discourses of history and culture.
          Not an essence but a positioning (<xref id="ID26f78149-b58b-4efb-ac6c-3ac7f73e3046" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID6c868883-f61b-4700-808d-068f433a7548">Hall 1990, 226, emphasis in

        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>In the realm of postcolonial studies, many authors (see, among others, Bhabha <xref id="ID1d749dd7-9f45-4d8e-858e-3a1ffc411349" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID3ab8006c-614c-4e9d-9bd3-8639412e31d4">1994</xref>; Hall 1990; <xref id="IDbc418e9c-c0b1-41c9-baa5-120a64f9dbea" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID9a98cb05-d215-4987-82dc-106496aaed2d">1994</xref>; 1996a; and 1997; Brah 1996)
          have pointed out how the cultural construction of (collective) identities plays an
          important role for people living in a diaspora or in other culturally complex
          environments. Similarly, my fieldwork and in-depth interviews with expatriate youths
          reveal that growing up “on the move” and in a transient space—despite
          all its privileges and opportunities—demands coping with constant changes and
          losses. The inherent questions of belonging and cultural identity are, to use Stuart
          Hall’s expression, an ongoing and ever-changing process of
          “positioning.”</p>
        <p>The following mind map <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">(Figure 2)</xref> was produced by the students Mia, Kressi, and Bjorn
          during Ethics class at a German school in December 2010 and allows for a good overview of
          their own complex ideas about identity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e326">27</xref> Their
          discussions, as the map illustrates, revolve around “Prägungen”
          (influences), such as “Erziehung” (education), “Freunde”
          (friends), “Kultur” (culture), and “Heimat” (home), as well as the
          idea of “eigenständige Entwicklung” (independent development). The
          students also discuss and agree on the “veränderbar” (changeable) nature
          of identity, for example “durch bestimmte Ereignisse” (through certain events)
          in life. Furthermore, the mind map shows that the students also consider how “viel
          nachdenken” (much contemplating) or “philosophieren” (philosophizing)
          can help one to find one’s identity. Such ways of thinking about their own position
          in the world demonstrate the power of reflexivity that Anthony Giddens (<xref id="ID6edaa286-f986-4630-b72d-116bc069770e" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDeeb5fd5a-6b4a-4109-979c-325d518449df">1991</xref>) conceptualized as
          humans’ ways of forging “narratives of the self.”</p>

        <p>The following four student portraits illustrate such “narratives or the self”
          and highlight expatriate students’ individual processes of cultural identity
          positioning. These narratives have to be seen in the context of fieldwork and the
          encounters between the students and myself out of which they emerged.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e338">28</xref> However, the students gave these accounts not only to feed my
          story, but also to make sense of their own experiences and selves through narrative. As
          Nigel Rapport’s (<xref id="ID39e2f0c2-132a-48e6-baee-26110a53a7e5" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID33b04e57-ddbe-4f8d-8ff2-6a49d9b818cf">2000</xref>) approach highlights, it is
          through such “narrative constructions of past, present and future, of relations of
          sameness and difference,” that the young people’s “self is given
          content, is delineated and embodied” (<xref id="IDa38839dd-e1df-4cbc-8a15-fd75857e0264" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID33b04e57-ddbe-4f8d-8ff2-6a49d9b818cf">ibid., 76</xref>). While all people go
          through such processes of negotiating their individual identities through narratives, the
          following four teenagers’ discursive understandings of the self reveal that their
          identity practices are particularly shaped by their experiences with multiple moves. Their
          moves bring about various shifting points of reference and borders along or across which
          they must navigate to find their own position.</p>

          <title>4.1. Antonia: I consider myself Shanghainese, but others see me as a
            foreigner</title>
          <p>In December 2010, while I am nervously introducing my research project to the eleventh
            grade students at the German school, a girl in the back of the room suddenly suggests
            that, if I want to know more about expatriate youth culture, I should study nightlife.
            Indeed, in the coming days, this sixteen-year-old girl, Antonia, invites me to come
            along to a Friday night out at the club Mural. Antonia turns out to be a key
            “gate-opener” to leisure spaces and, over the course of my fieldwork, often
            includes me in various group activities. I record a first group-interview with Antonia
            and her two friends Olivia and Charlie in January 2011. Later, two individual interviews
            follow: an extensive one in a downtown café in September 2011 and a brief one in
            her home in June 2012. We regularly spend time together during nightlife activities with
            “the girls,” at dinners, or at school, and continue to meet after her move
            to Germany in the summer of 2012.</p>
          <p>Antonia was born in Germany but grew up in Shanghai and, as mentioned previously, is
            one of the very few expat teenagers who have been at the same school all their lives.
            Her father is German, her mother a successful Chinese businesswoman who studied in
            Germany. Over the course of my fieldwork I came to know Antonia as a determined, smart
            young woman, who likes to feel she is in control of things and has high expectations for
            herself. She enjoys discussions and is known to other students for her vigorous debating
            skills, as well as for her generosity. Antonia herself often stresses how different she
            is from other expatriate children who only spend a few years in Shanghai. </p>
          <p>Sitting outside in a downtown café in early September 2011, as we are trying to
            converse despite Shanghai’s street noises, Antonia tells me that she only knows
            Germany from holidays and reflects upon her recent stay in Europe four weeks prior to
            the interview. </p>
          <p>

              <p><italic>When I come to Germany, I have to get used to it. Every time. What I also find annoying in Germany are things like inviting people, like, they take the bill, “well, you have to pay 4.20.” But I don’t have twenty cents right then. Things like that. That’s much more relaxed with my friends here.</italic>

            <p>It is Chinese custom to invite your friends and pay for everyone. Antonia and her friends sometimes also share the cost of eating out or going for a drink, but she finds practices in Germany, such as splitting the bill, particularly pedantic. Antonia generally distances herself from such cultural practices that she considers typically German and describes many incidents in Germany that she has found rather alienating. In the interview that we recorded in June 2012, Antonia also voices her concern about her upcoming move to Germany and her anxieties about being able to fit in.</p>
            <p>While not considering herself “really German,” she also talks about the experience of being perceived as a foreigner in Shanghai.</p>

          <p>Antonia speaks Chinese at home with her grandmother and her ayi. In the interview quote
            above she, nevertheless, describes how impossible it is to be “Chinese,” as
            she is constantly labeled as a “foreigner” or an “exotic animal”
            by Chinese citizens, such as the local university students she occasionally converses
            with in nightlife settings. Antonia’s life seems to oscillate between two defining
            poles, “German” and “Chinese.” Between having a German passport
            and receiving a German school education, while having spent the last fourteen years in
            Shanghai, Antonia—along with other individuals in her life—finds that both
            models of cultural identity are contestable and neither seems to fit her. Furthermore,
            being a child of a mixed marriage and speaking both languages at home also means that
            difference is also present in the intimacy of the domestic sphere.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e398">31</xref> Family life therefore does not offer a clear point of reference with
            which to position herself, either. </p>
          <p>When we discuss the expatriate lifestyle in Shanghai, Antonia shares how she sees
            herself as part of the expatriate collective:</p>

          </p>
          <p>Antonia addresses the exclusion of Chinese locals by using the term
            “bubble” to describe expatriate life, a metaphor that was also used by Paul,
            whose experiences I laid out in the introduction. She simultaneously attributes a sense
            of community to her “expat bubble,”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e428">33</xref> as
            well as being different from not only German but also Chinese society, which she

          <p>While she does not consider herself to be an integral part of the “expatriate
            bubble,” i.e. an isolated world of foreigners mingling in Shanghai that excludes
            locals, a new form of cultural identity emerges from the mixture of
            “Germanness” and “Chineseness” that creates her subjective
            experience of Shanghai—an expatriate community that is almost a “different
            nationality.” She sees this community to which she feels she belongs as an
            amalgamation, a perspective that she also applies to herself. It is this perspective
            that I conceptualize as transcultural. As I argue in the introduction of this book, such
            a transcultural perspective can shed light on the act of shifting and merging different
            cultural practices and positions to create new subjectivities. It can also enlighten
            moments of boundary-drawing and practices of making distinctions.</p>
          <p>During our interviews, Antonia looks at the different influences on her life and tries
            to grasp and narrate them from just such a perspective, to demonstrate that she feels
            uncomfortable positioning herself as being either “German” or
            “Chinese.” Instead of simply making “expatriate” (or,
              similarly, “Third Culture Kid”) her main identity reference, she
            strategically claims a hybrid form of urban citizenship to express her narrative of the
            self: “I consider myself Shanghainese.” This positioning is not about
            rejecting being Chinese, German, or expat, but about embracing all these points of
            references in its amalgamated state. This is of course her subjective positioning and
            does not necessarily reflect the common discourse of being Shanghainese (shanghairen), which, despite the idea of migration and Westernization making
            up much of the discourse on Shanghai’s specific culture (haipai) (<xref id="ID290c5c49-d0be-4603-873d-0fd6566c610c" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDd85f4970-baa8-48e5-99f2-e1e76ed213ff">Farrer 2002, 88–92</xref>), is
            usually tied to being born in Shanghai, speaking Shanghainese, and having a Shanghai
            residence permit (hukou) (<xref id="IDfa2df50d-7c03-47ba-80a5-75f7f782380a" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDfeeb335a-7b1a-41d1-882f-71c37d1f68bb">see Schoon 2007</xref>). As Antonia points out, the
            Chinese locals might not accept her self-identification as Shanghainese. </p>
          <p>While drinking coffee and gazing at the passing cars, bikes, bicycles, and pedestrians

          <p>Antonia speaks enthusiastically about exploring Shanghai and experiencing the urban
            environment. The city provides a host of impressions that energize her. Antonia feels
            that Shanghai is her home (see Part II, Chapter 2 for a detailed
            discussion). To her, the urban experience of living in Shanghai is a point of
            identity reference that bridges the various differences in her life because, to her, the
            city includes all of them.</p>
          <p>Antonia’s story shows, in the words of Stuart Hall (<xref id="ID6b25dc3d-2fc9-43a1-be64-fad224a67e8f" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID6c868883-f61b-4700-808d-068f433a7548">1990, 227</xref>), that “the
            boundaries of difference are continually repositioned in relation to different points of
            reference.” While Antonia stresses her ways of bridging the boundaries between
            German, Chinese, and expatriate circles that she experiences as being tied to certain
            cultural practices and processes of labeling, Bjorn, the next student I present,
            positions himself as someone who must come to grips with the class boundaries that
            emerged following his family’s move to Shanghai.</p>

          <title>4.2. Bjorn: Shanghai is the best thing that can happen to you, if you’re a
            villager</title>
          <p>While sitting in class and listening to the teachers and students, the first thing I
            particularly notice about Bjorn is his rolling “r,” a hint at his Bavarian
            background. Bjorn is sixteen years old when I first meet him at the German school in
            December 2010, and has only been in Shanghai since the beginning of the school year a
            few months earlier, when his father’s job posting forced his family to relocate.
            He had never lived outside the small village that he grew up in and, during an early
            group interview with two other boys, Don and Alex, he shares that he was initially
            against his parents’ move to China. </p>
          <p>After December 2010, I regularly meet Bjorn at school, and during nightlife activities
            or school outings, where we chat or listen to reggae music on one of our MP3 players.
            Bjorn is particularly familiar with German reggae artists, German popular culture, and
            cultural practices among youths outside the expatriate community. We regularly exchange
            reggae music and also bond over our common experience of having grown up in a small
            German village, where social class differences seemed non-existent to us as children. I
            observe how Bjorn quickly establishes friendships with his new classmates and becomes
            part of the group that I come to label as “the boys.” Nonetheless, in June
            2012, one and a half years after our first interview, he shares in retrospect that
            finding out “which friends suit me best” has been difficult. Still, Bjorn
            seems to be the link between the two gendered peer groups in his class by interacting
            with both “the girls” and “the boys.” Because I spend much more
            time with “the girls,” it is perhaps unsurprising that Bjorn is one of the
            boys I feel most comfortable talking to and who becomes one of my key male informants
            over the course of my fieldwork.</p>
          <p>Throughout our many conversations, it becomes clear that Bjorn’s narratives of
            the self (<xref id="ID7efef0fa-4a5a-4217-b176-4031061b4e47" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDeeb5fd5a-6b4a-4109-979c-325d518449df">Giddens 1991</xref>) position him as
            someone who must come to grips with the move from a rural area with a narrow social
            demographic to an urban, culturally-diverse area in general, and with new social class
            distinctions in particular. In contrast to many of his classmates, Bjorn has just
            experienced his first move abroad and sometimes feels uncomfortable with the expatriate
            lifestyle. The move to Shanghai brought with it a certain awareness of differences in
            financial means and social class. He often describes his life in Germany and contrasts
            it to his new social circle in Shanghai. During my time in Shanghai, he often states his
            preferences for places like the shop (see Part IV, Chapter 3) to high-end bars and
            occasionally voices his annoyance about everyone in Shanghai wanting the “high
            life” and how he misses “acting a bit antisocial” (bisschen asozial
              Getue).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e495">36</xref> In June 2012, as we are sitting
            at the French café next to his school discussing what being an expat actually
            means, he illustrates his view:</p>

If you’re a senator or a first class passenger at Lufthansa for instance, you get, for example, into this Lufthansa Lounge and you don’t sit with all the others, the somehow ordinary, down there on these nasty seats. Instead, you are sitting on a massage chair, drinking your drink, eating a little caviar. That’s being an expat. Being an expat is: “What does your daddy do?” “He does this and that.” “Well, and what do you do here?” “I drink up all the money that my dad earns.” That’s an expat.</italic>  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e452">37</xref>

          </p>
          <p>Bjorn, by exaggerating the comforts offered by an expatriate lifestyle, emphasizes the
            issue of class that preoccupies him. He chooses the metaphor of flying first class to
            describe his expatriate life, a metaphor that, for him, is tied to class-consciousness
            and distinctions from the “ordinary.” Bjorn highlights the practice of
            making distinctions that anthropologist Jacqueline Knörr (<xref id="ID97e2e107-8bed-4482-9e75-1a704ce15f46" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID2a9f3b82-c8a8-43c3-8cc9-1dd01fa3b7ac">2005</xref>) has likewise found
            underlying the concept of TCKs and which led her to criticize TCK identity as being an
            unproductive means of coping with the migration experience. Knörr, based on her
            study of German expatriate youths who lived in Africa, argues:</p>   <p>
        <disp-quote id="dispquote15">
          <p>Creating a “TCK” world and ideology of difference as a result of having
            been brought up in an expatriate environment may well not be primarily a sign of actual
            third-culturedness, but of a transformation of an expatriate ideology of “natural
            superiority” over the local African population to a “TCK” ideology of
            “cultural superiority” over the “ordinary” local German
            population—a transformation, which neither supports a child's (re-)integration nor
            its further personal development (<xref id="ID693d0c6c-3f41-48ce-b281-f8435993d864" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID6191b950-9b5f-4d80-90ca-b48e35f5bd5d">Knörr 2005,

          </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>The expatriate youths I accompanied constantly experienced how a high social standing
            is attributed to them due to their financial means in comparison to the local living
            standard, their private and international education, their many travels, and their
            multi-lingualism. Everybody believes they will be the makers of the future, whether this
            is emphasized in the MUN (Model United Nations)—where students critically engage
            with global issues—or in the school headmaster’s and German consul’s
            graduation speech (see Part V, Chapter 1).</p>
          <p>It is thus tempting for these teenagers, as Knörr describes above, to feel
            superior to locals, whether in the “host” or “home” country. The
            TCK ideology (here, again, I agree with Knörr) channels this superiority and gives
            it a form of expression which helps to maintain such feelings. The TCK concept seems to
            leave insufficient room for reflection and often rather surfaces as a form of TCK
            nationalism that claims hybridity for their own TCK nationals while also essentializing
            others.</p>
          <p>Although his account might be prompted in part by a desire to downplay his privileged
            position through self-stigmatizing, Bjorn self-reflectively contemplates and comments on
            the issue of status in his life, instead of using his privileged lifestyle as a major
            identity source. The borders he experiences between his friends in Shanghai and in
            Germany might be difficult to bridge, but the awareness of class is something expatriate
            life has taught him.</p>
          <p>To me, comparing expatriate life to flying first class also offers another
            interpretation: flying can be seen as symbolic of viewing the world from above, of both
            observing and crossing borders. It is this disturbing class-consciousness, this
            awareness of his advantages—which he nevertheless deeply enjoys—that mark
            Bjorn’s Shanghai experience. While feeling uncomfortable with the luxury and
            privilege his new life brings, he simultaneously enjoys these benefits and considers his
            stay a positive experience. Bjorn is also aware of how his new experience has changed
            his outlook, his ideas about the future, and his confidence about what might be possible
            for him to achieve.</p>

          <p>He labels himself (or his pre-Shanghai-self) a villager (Dorfmensch) who learned both
            new ways to live life and new possibilities after moving to the metropolis. In contrast
            to his peers at school, Bjorn never talks about negotiating his cultural identity in
            terms of questioning his “Germanness.” This might be due to his upbringing
            in a single village in Bavaria. In contrast to the other students, the move to Shanghai
            has been the only one in his life. It is rather the differences between rural and urban,
            and the status and class consciousness, which came with the experience of moving, that
            startle and unsettle him.</p>
          <p>When it comes to ways of coping with this experience of class distinction and the
            privileged expatriate lifestyle, Bjorn—besides gaining a reflective
            perspective—develops plans to counterbalance this experience by having “a
            few challenges.” During our last interview in June 2012, just after his
            graduation, Bjorn tells me about his plans to study in Europe (outside Germany) starting
            the following year. He first wants to stay in Shanghai and take a Chinese language
            course with his girlfriend Kressi. Bjorn explains that he particularly dreams of making
            it on his own, without the help of his parents and their networks. His parents suggested
            sending him for a few months to Peru where he could live with a German family they know
            from Shanghai and intern at a German consulate.</p>

          <p>This quote again reveals how Bjorn processes his experiences of class consciousness and
            class difference that create one aspect of the expatriate community. His example of
            renting a furnished apartment via the Internet is reminiscent of expatriate packages
            which include services to help with renting furnished villas in Shanghai. Bjorn is
            looking for ways to “earn” his privileges in the future or to be treated the
            same way as people of a lower social standing. Having met people from many different
            places, he wants to continue an international education to keep broadening his
            perspective, but plans to do so by what he calls choosing a path “with a little
            trouble.” </p>
          <p>While expatriate student Bjorn is coping with the borders of class between his friends
            in Germany and his friends in Shanghai, another student, Arnaud, is dealing with the
            messy negotiations of differences within the intimate sphere of the family and with his
            own in-between position.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>4.3. Arnaud: When you are in-between, you can't be the best at anything</title>
          <p>When I first meet Arnaud in June 2011, he is sixteen years old and enrolled at a French
            school in Shanghai. Arnaud has been introduced to me by the German school student
            Matthias, whom I have mentioned previously. The two know each other from jam sessions in
            the music room on the German-French school campus. After exchanging several text
            messages, Arnaud and I agree to meet downtown, at a Starbucks coffee shop on Hengshan
            Road. When Arnaud, with his long black hair tied back into a ponytail, his jeans,
            sneakers, and the obligatory headphones, shows up for the interview, I immediately like
            his polite and careful way of studying and answering the interview questions. </p>
          <p>Arnaud’s Chinese parents immigrated to Belgium for his father’s studies and
            career. Arnaud was born in Belgium and is a Belgian national. After his birth, his
            family moved to the outskirts of Paris, where they lived until Arnaud was nine years
            old, at which point his family decided to move to Shanghai for a career opportunity for
            his father, and to be closer to a sick grandparent.</p>
          <p>Sitting opposite me and carefully sipping his orange juice at our little corner table,
            Arnaud recounts his everyday routines. He particularly enjoys talking about his band,
            theater, and current writing projects. When discussing his moving experiences and his
            growing up in France and Shanghai, he comments on one aspect of his migration story that
            he finds difficult to cope with: the influence of his first years in France and his
            French education on his relationship with his parents, particularly his mother: </p>

                University. And he has a bit of European culture. But it really affects me how
                different me and my mom are in the head, in the mind. How maybe I am open-minded in
                some kinds of talking, and she is not. And sometimes it can be the opposite. It
                makes me a bit sad, cause I feel like maybe we would have more talking, with my
                parents, if I was Chinese. Maybe. It is mostly this. Because I don't only have a
                cultural difference with friends, or just everyone around, but also with my parents.
                And this really made me sad for some time. Just to know that I am different from my
                parents. I mean &lt;L&gt; everyone is different from their parents, but... </p>

              <p>And it really makes me sad sometimes. Cause I see. I got this French friend,
                […] he is a drummer […] and when I go to his place, I see how close he

            position himself in terms of cultural identity because he fears he is not “good
            enough” to identify or be identified as “French” or

            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>In the interview, Arnaud emphasizes his feeling that he, “sitting
            in-between,” cannot succeed in either of the two worlds and often feels lost
            wondering, “Where am I?” He expresses his ambitions to be good or even best
            at the things he does and how he feels like he is always one step behind his peers,
            whose cultural identity and language are less entangled and more supported by their
            parents. When I try to suggest a more positive interpretation, he laughs and cannot take
            it seriously. In contrast to the many students I interviewed, who stress their pride and
            the positive outcomes of growing up bilingually or in different cultural environments,
            Arnaud openly shares the difficulties of his way of growing up. Only at the end of our
            interview, does he briefly focus on the benefits of his life story and present a more
            positive outlook.</p>
          <p>Our interview demonstrates how a shared space between the ethnographer and the
            interviewee is opened, and how this space allows Arnaud to discuss growing up and his
            experience with differences and borders due to his specific upbringing. During the
            interview, Arnaud takes a perspective that aims to untangle and explain the various
            influences in his life, for instance the labeling he experiences due to his Asian
            phenotype and his French schooling, the differences between his and his parents’
            ways, or the difference between his and his friends’ relationships with their
            parents. He voices how these experiences of borders make him fear alienation from his
            parents and provoke his feeling of “sitting in-between.” Arnaud must cope
            with the constantly-shifting borders in his life that seem to prevent him from finding a
            stable position of cultural identity that can be confirmed by others, and which lead him
            to speak from a position he regards as being intermediate and unsatisfying.</p>
          <p>Arnaud handles his position in the “in-between” by finding creative
            outlets. When talking about his theater, literature, and band projects, Arnaud speaks
            with enthusiasm. His eyes shine brightly and he is proud of his success. Touring,
            publishing, making music—Arnaud tries to open up spaces to express himself
            creatively. He energetically gets involved in school plays and bands, and also writes
            short stories, all of which seem to be strategies for coping with his entangled world.
            He also dreams of a future marked by new creative, cultural, and physical spaces.
            Instead of staying in China or returning to France, he plans to move to Canada, to study
            music recording and continue his search for belonging by creatively and artistically
            bridging his different experiences. Xia, the final student described in this chapter,
            deals with problems similar to those of Arnaud. However, Xia uses educational
            achievement, rather than artistic expression, as his main strategy for managing the
            discrepancies he perceives in his life.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>4.4. Xia: I’d like to be like Einstein, a citizen of the world </title>
          <p>During the time I attend classes at the German school from December 2010 onwards, I see
            Xia on a regular basis and we occasionally chat. Eventually, I ask all under-age
            students in Xia’s class for their parents’ permission to do interviews. One
            day at school, Xia approaches me saying he might not be able to participate in an
            interview because his parents think he does not fit the definition of students I am
            studying. Due to the expatriate community’s familiarity with the idea of TCKs, I
            had used the term to explain my research agenda about expatriate youths in a letter to
            parents. Interestingly, Xia’s parents did not see their son as such a hybrid TCK
            and doubted he should participate.</p>
          <p>Seventeen-year-old Xia is a Chinese national who was granted exceptional permission to
            attend a German school by the Shanghai municipal government. Born in China, Xia moved to
            Germany with his parents after kindergarten to start his school career in Germany. His
            father obtained his doctorate at a German university and started working for a German
            company. After four years and one move within Germany, his parents decided to return to
            Shanghai. Although having been trained in Chinese writing after school and on weekends,
            Xia experienced difficulties with the entrance test to the local Chinese schools in
            Shanghai, because the education system and its ways of testing were unfamiliar to him.
            His parents therefore applied for a special permit so that Xia could attend the German
            school. Xia is a very strong student academically; however, his fellow students always
            regard him as different. </p>
          <p>When Xia approaches me with his parents’ doubts about fitting into my research
            project, I explain that the term can be debated and that anyone who is interested can
            join. A few days later, I am happy to see that his mother has signed the permission
            slip. When we meet for our first interview at the French café close to school, his
            parents’ initial objections to him participating are still on our minds, and we
            discuss the politics of cultural identity and intergenerational conflicts. </p>
          <p>In this first interview in spring 2011, with my voice recorder, our coffee cups, and my
            questionnaire between us, Xia tells me: “my parents sometimes think I don’t
            think Chinese enough.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e701">40</xref> He underlines
            his statement by giving the example of a discussion he recently had with them over
            dinner concerning the Chinese space program. He had shared his thoughts on the
            usefulness of the program, which, he suggested, might as well be seen as a waste of
            money and resources. His parents got angry, accusing him of not being proud of China. It
            is on the basis of this story and accusation that we discuss his negotiations with his
            parents and his feelings about belonging during our interview.</p>

          <p>The use of aquatic plants as an image of rootlessness symbolizes Xia’s
            parents’ worries about their son’s future. Xia himself does not discard this
            image, but suggests that his “roots are where the people that you like most
            are.” He rejects the necessity of a fixed and essentialized feeling of belonging
            tied to place or nationality, and ties feelings of belonging to his friends. In contrast
            to Arnaud, Xia does not comment on the emotional effects that the conflict with his
            parents evoke. I think, however, that Xia’s parents’ fear is not only about
            lacking patriotism or fearing their son is rootless, but might also be similar to
            Arnaud’s worries of alienation. Xia, in his narrative, particularly highlights the
            role that the difference between the world at home and the world at school might play in
            this conflict. He sees his conflict with his parents as mainly arising out of their
            different upbringing and understanding of an ideal education, despite his father having
            received his PhD in Germany.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e77510">42</xref>

          <p>For Xia, managing various zones and differences during his everyday life has become
            normal. Steve Vertovec (<xref id="IDb7df6959-5e25-44fb-8503-0a4d3cf9def8" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7c9b6b22-8083-4eb2-9183-76a773d41615">1997, 294</xref>) refers
            to the competency in improvising from various, sometimes crisscrossing cultural and
            linguistic systems as “milieu moving.” Xia’s competence in
            “milieu moving” also brings about specific challenges. He must learn to
            “navigate processes of identification” with different norms and practices
            and “learn how to manage tensions between conformity and individuality”
              (<xref id="ID1e1b915d-a632-4ab7-a79d-364e87eaa00d" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDd826fca2-0f99-4954-bde1-0f32bd67c38b">Sporton, Valentine, and Nielsen 2006,
              214</xref>). </p>
          <p>Xia’s experience brings us back to the methodological discussions in the
            introduction. His situation is similar to that of anthropologist Danau Tanu (<xref id="ID707cd484-480f-4f4f-b433-173af00160f2" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDd7270c8d-ae2f-40d4-a220-0829664cea3e">2011</xref>) who, as we have seen, claims
            that TCK literature underrepresents such ruptures in the everyday routine. Tanu
            describes her life as an Asian child in an international school abroad as living in
            “‘Western’ culture by day and ‘Asian’ culture by
            night” (Tanu <xref id="ID4dc5110e-ca49-4d6e-b6cf-9dc44cb5538f" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDd7270c8d-ae2f-40d4-a220-0829664cea3e">2011</xref>, 223). Although such milieus
            are not as homogeneous as Tanu’s description may suggest, students like Xia do
            experience ruptures when moving between them and bridging different cultural practices
            in their everyday routines. This is a prime example of the practice Pütz (<xref id="IDa1339e92-bd83-4aa8-b72b-7191fdc346b4" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID82c7e524-e508-4548-948f-c17c41a8664f">2004, 13</xref>) calls “everyday
            transculturality.” Xia often reflects upon his shifting cultural frame of
            reference as well as his own position and acts accordingly. Such reflections exemplify
            Pütz’s notion of “strategic transculturality” (<xref id="ID7070f22a-095f-4b6b-a4f1-8ecb0bb9d465" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID82c7e524-e508-4548-948f-c17c41a8664f">ibid., 28</xref>), the competency of
            moving reflexively within different symbolic systems (see Introduction).</p>
          <p>At school, I observe how Xia has difficulty getting along with some of the students.
            They are different from him, Xia explains, because they came from Germany to China and,
            unlike him, did not move from China to Germany first. However, he says that he has much
            in common with other students whose parents have Chinese origins. Reflecting upon his
            relationship to his classmates, he says that it is mainly with these students that he
            gets along well.</p>

            much more common notion of ABCs (American Born Chinese). Wondering about this potential
            form of collective identity, I ask Xia if and why he feels more comfortable interacting
            with Chinese-German teenagers.</p>

          <p>One binding experience of these “GBC” students seems to be their
            parents’ outlook on the importance of education and doing well in school. While
            the expatriate experience is a unifying framework in the construction of an expatriate
            identity at the international schools, as I will discuss in Part III, Chapter 3,
            Xia’s comment shows that this community can be divided and that students with a
            Chinese background are sometimes regarded as a distinct sub-group. Talking about these
            experiences shared among students with Chinese relatives, Xia alludes to the
            difficulties he sometimes encounters with other students at his school. When I ask him
            about specifics, he does not expand upon the issue. I inquire further, and he
            explains:</p>

          <p>In his everyday life, Xia experiences the different practices and views of students
            from various backgrounds, which he terms “perspectives.” He voices his
            desire to be able to look at things from such different “perspectives.” I
            argue that Xia already possesses that ability and demonstrates it on a daily basis when
            gliding through the different “milieus” at home and at school, in answering
            to German teachers, spending time with fellow expatriate students, and eating dinner
            with his Chinese parents. In the introduction, I conceptualize this skill of adjusting,
            but also of reflecting upon these changes throughout the day, as requiring a
            transcultural perspective. Xia’s accounts of discussions with his parents and his
            reflections on his position at school illustrate how taking such a perspective is not an
            effortless or frictionless process:</p>

          <p>Xia’s description of himself as a “foreigner”—although he is a
            Chinese national currently living in China—is startling. It seems as if he has
            taken the expatriate community as a point of reference and positions himself as part of
            a minority. Furthermore, he is worried about his future experiences in Germany, where he
            plans to study, and fears possible exclusion and discrimination due to his name,
            appearance, and passport. Xia elaborates further on the constraints associated with the

          <p>Xia’s reference to Einstein is important for two reasons: first, it symbolizes
            his ideals about being educated, successful, and intelligent; second, it alludes to
            Einstein’s diasporic life on the move and Xia’s desire to be a
            Weltbürger, to be able to move around freely—a goal he feels the world should
            be moving towards. Xia experiences cultural identity not only as a position, or as a
            performance, but also realizes how it is relational, depending on others and on
            citizenship. Xia understands that, despite his own flexible and creative outlook on
            cultural identity and belonging—“I consider myself
            international”—he feels the weight and constraints of difference and being
            “othered.” He intends to cross these borders through education and
            achievement. </p>
          <p>Xia’s experience growing up in Germany and Shanghai led him to understand the
            difficulties inherent to taking different perspectives and bridging differences. While
            this makes Xia aware of certain restrictions in his life, for others (as Paul explains
            in the introduction), boundaries cross and blur in subjective experiences of growing up
            on the move, making the many shifting points of identification seemingly impossible to
            locate. </p>
          <p>My focus on the everyday practices of expatriate youths in the following analytical
            parts of this ethnography examines some of these shifting points of identification and
            belonging for young privileged migrants. These points include the youths’ homes,
            schools, expatriate spaces, and leisure activities. Before I move on to these analytical
            parts, however, I offer some background showing how my fieldwork was conducted and how I
            collected the data on which the rest of this book is based.</p>

        <p>My introduction of expatriate youths in general, the first ethnographic descriptions of
          their life at school, and the interviews with several individuals that appear here have
          already shown how heterogeneous experiences of growing up as a young, international school
          student in Shanghai can be. To do justice to this heterogeneity, I continue to share many
          direct voices from various students and their different migration experiences throughout
          this ethnography. </p>
        <p>During eleven months of fieldwork from mid-August 2010 to early July 2011,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1096">50</xref> a short stay after the summer school break in
          September 2011, and another two-week stay in May/June 2012, I held a total of thirty-one
          group and individual interviews with forty-three students.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1103">51</xref> The majority of these students were between fifteen and
          eighteen years old and enrolled at the German school I introduced above, or a Singaporean,
          British, French, or American Christian school. I additionally conducted one expert
          interview with a school counselor at another American school and discussed my research
          topic with a few teachers, but decided to use these as background information only.
          Similarly, six months of prior fieldwork on the adult expatriate community in Shanghai,
          which I conducted in 2007, provided further context for my work.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1110">52</xref> This ethnography, however, is based on a voice-centered
          approach that focuses on the students’ own words and perspectives because
          youths’ own accounts of migration experiences have largely been ignored until
          recently (<xref id="IDc764f338-0285-4480-8a1a-62622a6ac5b1" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDbea8ef8e-44f3-43cd-ae89-b6750eb5d79a">see Dobson 2009</xref>).</p>
        <p>The questions for the group discussions and the first round of individual interviews
          focused on addressing issues related to moving to Shanghai and everyday activities there.
          Both the group discussions and the individual interviews were semi-structured. This means
          that, although a specific set of questions was posed, these could vary in order and
          emphasis to offer teenagers and myself enough flexibility to introduce and respond to
          other issues. This approach therefore acknowledged my own research agenda to understand
          specific issues from the teenagers’ point of view, as well as the students’
          agency by providing space for them to present new topics. The second round of
          semi-structured interviews dealt with new issues that were either under-represented or
          unclear in the first round, for instance reflections upon the students’ position or
          integration in China and the experience and meaning of specific locations in Shanghai.
          These were conducted at the end of the school year in spring/summer 2011 or after the
          break, during my return visit in September 2011. A third round of interviews with the same
          students focused on the topic of leaving and plans for the immediate future and was
          recorded during the last follow-up stay in May–June 2012. Between 2012 and 2015,
          further interviews with students were conducted in Germany to discuss issues of returning. </p>
        <p>All interviews were transcribed, coded, and interpreted in the context of my field notes
          and theoretical foundations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1126">53</xref> The program
          Atlas.ti ensured a systematic process.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1135">54</xref>
          Throughout the interpretation, I worked with the original quotes and only translated
          German quotes into English as a very last step in my text production. For the final
          translations, I omitted some fillers, repetitions, and pauses for better readability. Due
          to my focus on the youth’s own voices, these interviews form the centerpiece of my
          ethnography. I also worked with various visual materials and methods to gain further
          perspectives on the youths’ experiences.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1142">55</xref> While visual materials are included throughout the ethnography, five images
          were selected to introduce each of the book’s five parts. These images aim to
          provide a space for each part’s ethnographic and theoretical arguments to unfold. </p>
        <p>Numerous, free, English-language magazines that circulate in Shanghai, as well as
          advertisements, flyers, websites, and online forums provided further insights into the
          lifestyles of the expatriate community.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1162">56</xref> As
          part of his inquiry into middle class youth culture in Nepal, anthropologist Mark Liechty
            (<xref id="ID6e2800e0-4746-4b24-a579-258dd79cfbb9" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDdc3ed0eb-469a-4963-80e6-d1c64174811c">2003</xref>) read magazines targeted at
          Nepali teenagers as part of a “global, intertextual media assemblage that constructs
          its own privileged world of reality-in-images.” He further writes, “it is onto
          this transnational public sphere, the media-assembled space of imagination, that local
          merchants project their dreams of a local ‘youth culture’” (<xref id="ID827d71c1-6160-4bf0-b39a-3c4549b309f2" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDdc3ed0eb-469a-4963-80e6-d1c64174811c">ibid., 219</xref>). Following
          Liechty’s understanding, I collected media in Shanghai to understand how an
          expatriate culture or community is created. Liechty’s concept of media assemblage as
          “an intricate web of linkages that promote and channel consumer desires in
          never-ending circuits” (<xref id="ID445be377-1556-4e37-8bd2-9d3ecff7836f" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDdc3ed0eb-469a-4963-80e6-d1c64174811c">ibid., 260</xref>)
          illuminates how media can fuel, as Brosius (<xref id="ID0c79f9c3-c66b-490c-8834-eff4a823ea07" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4c9106cb-6d90-4910-b3d4-8d81eeaa2302">2010, 37</xref>) has phrased it, “a
          consumer ethic that affirms and ‘naturalises’ cultural values and habitus of
          the middle class” (and, in my case, the expatriate community). The media assemblage
            (<xref id="ID79b7eb8c-c322-48fb-b299-85f5a81b9026" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDdc3ed0eb-469a-4963-80e6-d1c64174811c">Liechty 2003 </xref> and <xref id="IDcfbdb8f1-f683-4bd7-a77c-6061db21d617" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0bf42131-4447-47a3-b7c0-f8a5011b327e">Brosius 2011</xref>) functions as a
          methodological tool in the quest for a wider context of how expatriate communities are
          produced by tracing expatriates’ consumption, education, work, travel, and leisure
          habits. The magazines and forums proved particularly helpful because their main purpose
          was to introduce newcomers to Shanghai to the expat lifestyle and consumption habits. In
          her examination of practices of the new middle class in India, Brosius pinpoints
          media’s potential for offering an introduction or guidance: “These intertwined
          forms of media are crucial when it comes to their capacity to educate
          ‘uncultured’ newcomers, creating immediacy and intimacy” (<xref id="IDcfbdb8f1-f683-4bd7-a77c-6061db21d616" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4c9106cb-6d90-4910-b3d4-8d81eeaa2302">2010, 36</xref>). The media assemblage
          facilitates understanding the community’s current discourses and contextualizes my
          focus on expatriate teenagers.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I collected mental maps at the end of several group discussions and during
          a geography class. Thirteen students at the German school, three at a British school,
          seventeen students from a Singaporean school, and one student from an American school were
          asked to record on paper their mental maps of everyday, important places in Shanghai.
          Mental maps, a common method in geographical research, are particularly useful for
          understanding everyday spatial practices. Mental mapping allows the research partner to
          establish a focus from his or her own perspective and thus—despite being limited by
          a guiding question—leaves more room for subjective experiences than interviewing
          alone (<xref id="IDd2234122-cb44-4153-8826-6d2015b219bf" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID52cd459b-0dc8-438f-a263-e03bde96b1d1">Ploch 1995, 24</xref>). Consequently, the
          drawings of students’ “personal Shanghais” are subjective
          interpretations based on their active reflections and ways of giving spaces meaning (<xref id="ID82b775cf-5094-4c63-8fca-fc6314136a06" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID52cd459b-0dc8-438f-a263-e03bde96b1d1">ibid., 25</xref>).</p>
        <p>The various materials and methods that I employed to capture expatriate youths’
          experiences all illustrate the heterogeneity of the group I chose to study. Many factors
          influence their transient time in Shanghai, whether it is their first time abroad or their
          families are constantly moving. The students may need to negotiate differences within
          their family or between family and school, regardless of whether their parents also have
          migrant biographies. However, based on the theoretical understanding of transculturality
          as progress, practice, and perspective that I present in the introduction, we can see that
          these different individual experiences have several things in common. One major unifying
          point is the various processes of negotiating cultural identities and forms of belonging
          that seem to affect all youths growing up on the move; I highlighted these in the four
          individual narratives provided by Antonia, Bjorn, Arnaud, and Xia, as well as in
          Paul’s story in the introduction. These five student portraits and their reflections
          upon their social worlds and their position within them illustrate how teenagers have
          myriad ways of forging, performing, and contesting their own feelings and sense of
          belonging. I do not aim to create a typology that fixes certain experiences into set
          categories, but my research does show that common ground underlies the students’
          diverse experiences and subjective narratives. My own transcultural perspective, my
          heuristic viewpoint from which I capture the various influences, connections, and
          practices that youths draw from in their everyday lives, reveals that mobility brings with
          it the shifting of various points of reference and boundaries. As Stuart Hall’s
          quote above describes, expatriate students must find their own place of belonging
          somewhere within these points of reference and boundaries, be it within a peer group, the
          expatriate community, Shanghai itself, or to a nation, global youth culture, a privileged
          class, or a cosmopolitan elite. Due to the shifting places, practices, and people around
          them, these youths are all aware of the processes of developing ties, of arriving, of the
          efforts and boundaries that go into feelings of belonging and the construction and
          performance of cultural and collective identities. My investigation into their daily
          negotiations shows that, on the one hand, the construction or performance of collective
          identities entails the creation of cultural (and spatial) boundaries, and that these are
          sometimes entangled with racism, classism, sexism, or forms of fundamentalism. On the
          other hand, the creation of such collective cultural identities also opens up a
          much-needed shared space that helps the individual to cope with daily and emotional
          challenges when living in a culturally diverse or unknown environment. The concept of TCKs
          aims to foster such collective identities. My ethnographic examples, however, demonstrate
          that expatriate youths are often moving along borders that commonly mark collective
          identities and that they frequently rethink, bridge, cross, and shift these borders to
          find their own position, their own cultural identity. It is this common ground that I
          conceptualize as a “transcultural perspective.”</p>
        <p>Antonia, the child of a Chinese-German marriage, formulated her transcultural perspective
          as an experience of borders between being “Chinese” and “German”
          and chose to claim Shanghai as the major source of her hybrid cultural identity. Bjorn,
          who grew up in a small village in Germany, particularly highlighted his awareness of class
          and class differences when contemplating the influence that the move to Shanghai had on
          his life. Arnaud, a French-educated, Belgium national whose Chinese parents moved to
          Europe to eventually return to Shanghai, reflected on and articulated his worries about
          feeling different from his parents. Chinese student Xia, enrolled at the German school,
          expressed his general awareness of borders between himself and his fellow students who are
          European nationals, particularly in regard to the constraints his Chinese passport and
          family background place on him. He also reflected upon the difficulties of dealing with
          differences between school and home. </p>
        <p>Their accounts demonstrate that these teenagers are very interested in sharing and
          discussing their views, in opening up a shared space in which they can articulate their
          transcultural perspectives, and investigating the roles of mobility, cultural practices,
          and differences in their lives. The “narratives of the self” (<xref id="IDd6f7223d-d270-4298-84f6-bb1d0db1f075" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDeeb5fd5a-6b4a-4109-979c-325d518449df">Giddens 1991</xref>) that the expatriate
          youths offered during interviews were triggered by questions about home or the challenges
          they faced, but were often also introduced by the teenagers themselves. </p>
        <p>These self-reflective practices of re-positioning demonstrate, as I have laid out in the
          introduction, that we should move away from grouping such experiences under the static TCK
          label and employ transcultural perspectives that allow us to understand the flexibility of
          youths’ practices and identities, as well as their ways of drawing boundaries. Upon
          engaging with this theoretical framework, it becomes clear that taking a transcultural
          perspective is exactly what these youths do in order to process their many moves and to
          grasp the shifting points of identification in their lives. At first glance, these
          transcultural perspectives may stand in contradiction to students’ everyday spatial
          practices of demarcation and class-consciousness that I discuss in relation to housing in
          Part III, Chapter 2.1 and the community of international schools in Part III, Chapter3.
          However, as discussed in the introduction, mobility can evoke both a desire for stability
          and a desire to broaden one’s point of view to manage the differences one
          experiences. Dwelling on the move itself does not eliminate, but rather fuels the wish to
          create familiar spaces, despite the next move being on the horizon. This dialectic becomes
          visible in more detail in the coming chapters, which zoom in on the students’
          everyday lives in Shanghai. While my concept of transcultural perspectives proves
          invaluable to understanding the experiences arising from these shifting borders and the
          subsequent emergence of new, subjective forms of cultural identity, it also requires a
          detailed ethnographic perspective that brings daily experiences to the fore, a necessity
          that became apparent in my introductory example of Paul’s narrative, which seems
          rather insubstantial for lacking it. Therefore, a solid analysis of everyday practices is
          necessary for understanding how individuals gain transcultural perspectives and the
          meanings they assign to them.</p>
        <p>Despite individual differences in how they deal with moving from one city or country to
          the next, the expatriate students in this ethnography all share the challenge of
          maintaining old ties while creating new ones in new communities. Their moves are what
          Giddens (<xref id="ID1dbefe91-a4bb-4c57-99bf-258a56c6c28e" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDeeb5fd5a-6b4a-4109-979c-325d518449df">1991, 112–114</xref>) calls
          “fateful moments,” meaning “times when events come together in such a
          way that an individual stands, as it were, at a crossroads in his existence” (<xref id="ID2c7c143a-0aa0-4753-bbb3-1b628c409fd4" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDeeb5fd5a-6b4a-4109-979c-325d518449df">ibid., 113</xref>). This ethnography
          highlights these crossroads and the changes privileged migration brings with it by
          recounting the move to and away from Shanghai. While writing from my point of view,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1188">57</xref> I understand their activities and emphasis on
          exploring Shanghai as a means of dealing with the difficulties the move forced them to
          confront, by linking everyday practices to their migration experiences. While focusing on
          the small-scale processes of everyday life, the next four parts therefore trace and
          examine the larger themes of leaving (Part II), arriving in Shanghai (Part III), living
          there (Part IV) and, finally, moving on (Part V).</p>

            <title><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Part II: Leaving</xref> </title>
            <p>Expatriate children often have biographies that involve several moves over the course
                of their young lives. Part II, “Leaving,” addresses retrospective
                accounts given by students on the circumstances of moving to Shanghai. It inquires
                into how expatriate youths perceive multiple relocations in general and considers
                what kind of challenges they face. Chapter 1 explores the youths’ narratives
                of leaving and their recollections of the processes that led to the decision to move
                to Shanghai. In this chapter, I argue that expatriate children have only limited
                agency in the familial decision-making as it concerns the move. Next, I investigate
                the idea of “best interest” that underlies many of the arguments for the
                move. While the parents’ feel they are making a decision which is in the
                “best interest” of the child and is mostly linked to future benefits,
                the children, in the here-and-now, constantly feel like they are living in a liminal
                space, where the last move has only just—or not even yet—been fully
                coped with, despite the next move already lying in wait. Chapter 2 is also connected
                to discussions about leaving and delineates the emotional challenges associated with
                moving to Shanghai. Based on the students’ commentaries, this chapter
                identifies their “culture shock,” reactions to an unfamiliar urban
                environment, new sensory impressions, and the lack of friends and extended family,
                as well as problems within the family, that are also related to the move. The
                different experiences of youths all make clear that the time of leaving and
                arriving—or what Ahmed, Castañeda, Fortier, and Sheller (<xref rid="IDa1af01c3-ebc3-4b7f-8c0d-b0edeb29f719" ref-type="bibr" id="ID62e89bf2-edea-4b1f-849a-04422867ec64">2003</xref>) call
                “uprootings”—are highly emotional. Part II, which is based on the
                youths’ retrospective narratives, provides a brief but essential background to
                the inquiries into the expatriate students’ daily practices in Shanghai that
                the following parts of this book, on arriving and living, explore in more depth.</p>

                <p>When talking about the move to Shanghai with students in group discussions or
                    individual interviews, the expatriate youths described their experiences of the
                    decision-making process that led to the move to Shanghai. When contemplating
                    these retrospectives of the move, it becomes obvious that the moments of
                    decision-making are remembered vividly. </p>

                <sec>
                    <title>1.1 To move or not to move: the decision-making process</title>
                    <p>By examining the children’s reflections upon the decision that was made
                        months, or even years, prior to the interviews, it becomes clear that my
                        interview partners reflected deeply upon their role in the process.
                        Throughout our conversations, three narratives of the children’s
                        involvement in the decision-making process became apparent: exclusion,
                        inclusion through a set of choices, and negotiation. As I only conducted my
                        research in Shanghai, of course only those voices of children whose families
                        actually decided to move are included. Rejections of the opportunity to move
                        to Shanghai, therefore, cannot be discussed.</p>
                    <p>Most of my young interview partners felt excluded from the decision-making
                        process and describe the move to Shanghai as a non-negotiable announcement
                        their parents made. Usually, the children did not want to move, but often
                        felt they had no choice, as Emily’s story illustrates. Emily, age
                        twelve, was born in her “home” country Malaysia, but left when
                        she was still too young to retain any memories of growing up there. She
                        arrived in Shanghai one and a half years prior to the interview and attends
                        a British English-medium middle school. When I interview her with fellow
                        students in a group discussion, she introduces herself by talking quickly
                        and animatedly:</p>

                            <p>I am Emily. I am from Malaysia. I am, I have never really lived or
                                had any childhood in Malaysia. I moved when I was three and my
                                brother was only six months old. I moved to Beijing, China, and I
                                lived there for six years, six and a half years, close to seven. And
                                then I moved to Thailand for eighteen months, which felt like a
                                really long time.</p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>She recalls her moving experiences as a set of events that would simply
                        happen to her, leading up to a feeling of unfair exclusion when the recent
                        move to Shanghai was announced.</p>

                                fair that we have to move. And then, but then I had no choice. I had
                                to follow my parents. So, I moved to Shanghai, and after Christmas
                                would be my second year here. Erm, it’s nice here, I will be
                                disappointed if I do leave next year, but yeah.</p>

                        at the German school, shares a similar story. She is half-Czech,
                        half-German, and came to Shanghai six months before the first interview.
                        When we sit in the schoolyard, the voice recorder between us, Karina

                    <p>Karina recapitulates her immediate strong reaction to the announcement of the
                        move to Shanghai: “I just screamed at my father.” I came across
                        many such narratives of anger, yelling at, or not speaking to the parents
                        for a couple of days in reaction to the sudden announcement of the move. </p>
                    <p>A few interviewees, however, such as Britta, a student from Norway, felt they
                        had a say in the decision by discussing at least certain options about their
                        participation in the move. When describing her first reactions to her
                        father’s announcement, Britta, a seventeen-year-old girl who had just
                        arrived in Shanghai a few months before the interview and attends an
                        international British school, recalls how she could not believe it or take
                        the idea of moving to China seriously at first. </p>
                    <p>

                            <p>I wasn’t that mad; I was more like I didn’t think about
                                it. I just said sure, we move to China. Not.</p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>However, when she started to realize that her parents were seriously
                        considering the move, she found herself and her family on a short trip to
                        China to explore the idea further. Such “look-and-see trips,”
                        which are paid for by the employer, are common. Yet, taking the children
                        along for these trips is less common. Consequently, Britta considered
                        herself lucky to have been able to get to know Shanghai before the final
                        decision to relocate was made. Furthermore, she explains how her family
                        explored alternative options:</p>

                                friend’s family. But I chose to go anyway. So. Would be weird
                                to just move in with her family when my family is just experiencing
                                new stuff, and I am just like stuck in Norway. </p>

                    <p>The opportunity to see what her life might look like in Shanghai and the

                        decision-making process and led to a positive curiosity and willingness to
                        explore new things with her family: “They didn’t just decide,
                        they let us choose.” Britta’s case can be seen as what Ackers
                        and Stalford (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e71ec37-4d8f-4952-961c-d1bd2bf8f7e1">2004,

                        “children’s menu approach.” The children are presented
                        with a “limited range of options” (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeb08c8e6-32ae-47a7-8171-da5fda69327a">ibid., 113</xref>), with
                        these options typically falling “within parameters tightly defined by
                        parents” (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3735b23b-a6f8-47f8-914f-10aec6c512d6">ibid.</xref>). Britta, for instance, was allowed to opt out of the move to
                        Shanghai, but not allowed to influence her parents’ decision.</p>
                    <p>Only seventeen-year-old Paul, whose story I discussed in the introduction,
                        described how he successfully managed to negotiate the decision about a
                        move, though in his case, it was the move away from and not to Shanghai.
                        Paul grew up in Brazil and the United States and moved to Shanghai six years
                        prior to the interview. At the time of the interview, he had just refused to
                        move again, this time to Thailand. “I wasn’t gonna move,”
                        he said. His father, nevertheless, went to Bangkok, while Paul and his
                        mother stayed in Shanghai. Paul’s initial reluctance to move to China,
                        which, to reiterate his phrase, he had not “even googled
                        before,” played no role in his parents’ decision. </p>
                    <p>In contrast to his lack of say in the matter and the fait accompli his father
                        delivered (“‘Paul, we are moving to China.’ Oh.”)
                        six years earlier, this time Paul managed to state his own opinion about the
                        move to Thailand and make his point. When I ask him about the difference in
                        these decision-making processes, he comments:</p>

                            <p>I am older now. Before I didn't really have a choice. And, erm, my
                                parents also thought it was a good idea to stay here. Cause of my
                                last year of school. You don't wanna move right before you are
                                applying for colleges and stuff. And your grades are really shit.
                                It's not so good. </p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>This time he influenced the decision-making process and the family found
                        common ground when reasoning why staying in Shanghai was beneficial for his
                        future. Interestingly, Paul had learned to employ a future-benefit and
                        best-interest narrative to argue for his desire to stay, and his parents
                        accepted it. The next section further examines the common idea of
                        best-interest that often underlies the parents’ decision-making and
                        family relationships.</p>

                    <title>1.2 Family relations and the idea of “best interest”</title>
                    <p>As my interview-partners’ narratives of the moving process show,
                        individual family members have different attitudes and interests regarding
                        the move to Shanghai. While some children rebel against the decision, others
                        trust their parents to know what is “best” for them. According
                        to my young interview-partners’ accounts of the decision to move, the
                        idea of their parents acting in their “best interest” is also
                        common. Teresa Hutchins’s (<xref rid="ID0298682b-2538-460b-9a40-55b271158be8" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdcf93edc-90d5-4170-a62a-4ca8e92d5ad8">2011</xref>) recent analysis
                        of UK families’ experiences with moving to Australia, showed that </p>
                    <p>family migration decision-making is based upon a process of negotiating
                        individual influence and power within the family, often at different stages
                        in the process. In the majority of families, children were active in their
                        attempts to influence adults, just as adults attempted to influence
                        children. In some cases the adults overrode the opinions of their children
                        and in others the children were successful in having their voices heard and
                        acted upon. In the majority of instances, parents justified their actions as
                        being in the best interests of their children (<xref rid="ID0298682b-2538-460b-9a40-55b271158be8" ref-type="bibr" id="ID267cf99b-d03f-41f5-9847-d52b50a783f6">Hutchins 2011,

                    <p>The main difference between the experiences of Hutchins’s informants
                        moving to Australia, and the narratives explored in this ethnography,
                        however, lies in the experience of Australia as a place of arrival and
                        Shanghai as a place of transition. Parents’ decisions to move are not
                        only past events, but likely to be announced in the future, as well. When
                        talking about moving again in the near future and the emotions this prospect
                        causes, Allen, an eleven-year old American who had just arrived in Shanghai
                        after his father had been transferred to China three months earlier,
                        comments: </p>

                        has pointed out correctly that this idea of children’s best interests
                        is problematic and that “little is known about how ‘best
                        interests’ are conceptualised, let alone operationalised, within
                        families.” Hutchins further argues that these varying
                        conceptualizations of best interest are based on the “particular
                        conception of childhood held by [...] parents” (<xref rid="ID0298682b-2538-460b-9a40-55b271158be8" ref-type="bibr" id="ID739d0586-7d59-47fc-850b-168f96b75c7f">2011, 1233</xref>). In the
                        expatriate community in Shanghai, the underlying conceptions of childhood
                        and adolescence often seem to be linked to the idea of children as
                        “adults in the making,” a viewpoint that is also influential in
                        academic concepts, as already critiqued in the Introduction. My discussions
                        with children, as well as interviews I conducted with adult expatriates in
                            2007,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e161">59</xref> show that expatriate
                        parents in Shanghai justify the difficulties they impose on their children
                        by stressing the—mainly future—benefits of transnational
                        mobility. Parents are concerned with their children’s adult lives,
                        sometimes even more than with their children’s current situation, as
                        the family’s move to China suggests. These supposed benefits and the
                        teenage students’ experiences with this future-oriented aspect of
                        their lives are discussed in detail in Part IV, Chapter 1 and in Part III,
                        Chapter 3 of this ethnography. Ackers and Stalford (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8005ecae-c010-419c-b8fb-3806b80ac71c">2004, 111</xref>),
                        researchers of European children’s rights, came across a similar
                        narrative of the decision-making process in their studies of EU-internal
                        migration—that of “future oriented consent,” where
                        “parents expressed the view that, even though it was inappropriate to
                        attempt to involve the child in the family decision at the point of
                        migration, the child would, in the longer term, see the value of the move
                        and reflect upon it positively“ (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID19c6e414-0006-4dfa-b45c-40d9114292109">Ackers and Stalford 2004,
                            111</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Hoping for this future consent of their children, expatriate parents often
                        disregard their potential to play an active part in the decision to move.
                        Hutchins (<xref rid="ID0298682b-2538-460b-9a40-55b271158be8" ref-type="bibr" id="ID231ed363-32a3-4ed3-8db6-1f878e9c9080">2011, 1233</xref>) assumes
                        that “it is also possible that the different conceptions of childhood
                        operate in parallel and that particular conceptions may be invoked at
                        different times in order to support the interests of adults.” The
                        powerful discourse of “best interest” is linked to ideas of
                        preparing the developing child for the future and is often used to exclude
                        children from the decision-making process. The concept of “best
                        interest” therefore strongly influences expatriate families’
                        decisions to move abroad.</p>
                    <p>Excluded from the decision to relocate, the students I talked to remember
                        being caught between the desire to stay with their friends in their familiar
                        environment and the wish to be with their parents. In the midst of these
                        contradictory feelings, children also have their own “best
                        interest” considerations for their parents. Seventeen-year-old German
                        student Lara explains: </p>

                                is not really a coming back option. But also, that a father wants

                    <p>Lara’s narrative illustrates how the decision to move feels, for many
                        of the youths, like being caught between their parents’ will and their
                        own. For intergenerational relations, this means that worries about the
                        other exist on both sides. Often, guilt may also play a role and complicate
                        family relationships. Karina, for instance, explained that her mother often
                        felt guilty about taking her away from her friends. Twelve-year-old Emily
                        from Malaysia describes how family relationships can become strained by the
                        emotional turmoil that a decision to move causes:</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="speech66">

                            <p>I think that one of the worst things to do is to actually panic,
                                because eventually you realize you have to move. You can’t
                                just stay there. Because, you know. Then, when I realized, you know,
                                when my dad said we are moving, I said “Okay, if we are
                                moving, will there be a chance that we ever move back here?”
                                He said “Erm, I don’t know.” When you hear that
                                “I don’t know” or that tone where you just have no
                                clue, you just know that you have to move. You can’t say
                                anything, because your parents would get, like, not upset, but kinda
                                feeling, having second thoughts now. I don’t want my parents
                                not to move just because of me. But it’s for my dad’s
                                job, so like, we just all have to move. As a family. We can’t
                                like stay here and my dad working there, and then coming back for
                                Christmas, that doesn’t make any sense. So we just have to
                                move.</p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>Emily’s narrative demonstrates well how children try to actively negotiate the
                relations within the family, reflect their own position, and consider their
                parents’ needs. Her thoughts on moving go beyond her own wish to stay and
                explore moving’s effects on family relationships and her parents’
                emotional well-being. She does not want her parents to worry about her or have
                “second thoughts” and comes to the conclusion that opposing the move is
                not an option. Emily’s inquiries about the option to move back also show how
                children wish to have insights into their parents’ plans and transparency
                about future moves. This might also be necessary for children to (re-)gain trust in
                their parents’ decisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e260">61</xref>

                    <title>1.3 Caught in limbo: fearing the next move</title>
                    <p>Uncertainties of what to expect are obviously inherent to a migration
                        experience. The fear of suddenly moving elsewhere (and failing to
                        “make it” there), however, seems particularly common within
                        highly mobile families. Emily’s description of her thoughts and past
                        feelings surrounding the move to Shanghai show that moving can be
                        overwhelming. She even speaks of panic over her inabiliaty to control the
                        decision to move and her emotions. Likewise, all the narratives of the
                        decision-making process show that the teenagers and children often
                        confronted their parents with anger when the move to China was announced.
                        From Emily’s point of view, however, to panic is “one of the
                        worst things to do.” Her narrative shows that children have to cope
                        with fears and that moving requires them to learn to manage their emotions.
                        The fear of having to move again, against one’s own will, however,
                        remains present, even when the students turn the limbo-like state of moving,
                        the experience of living in a liminal space, into something positive, as was
                        the case for seventeen-year-old Giovanni, a German school student and part
                        of “the boys,” who noted: “You are only here for a
                        temporary period. Like a long vacation.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e239">62</xref> The implications of this state of limbo on
                        negotiations of belonging and ideas of what constitutes home will be
                        elaborated on further in Part III, Chapter 2.</p>
                    <p>The honest inclusion of children in the decision-making and moving process
                        might help to reduce some of their fears and feelings of powerlessness.
                        Britta from Norway, for example, was extremely happy to have been able to
                        explore Shanghai before the move, which made it easier for her to cope with
                        the fear of being unhappy in Shanghai. But it is not only uncertainty, but
                        also unfamiliarity or even sensing their parents’ stress that makes
                        the experience frightening at first. The next chapter, consequently, takes a
                        closer look at the emotional challenges that leaving entails from the
                        perspective of expatriate students, while also drawing upon concepts which
                        explore the anthropology of emotions.</p>

                <title>Chapter 2: The Emotional Challenges of Moving</title>
                <p>The tyranny of distance and the particularities of place continue to unsettle
                    agents with a putatively global reach. (<xref rid="IDdd559141-943d-45ed-a785-de7127b8eb7a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDea022ada-37ab-48b4-9355-91d39b7aef97">Ley 2004, 157</xref>)</p>
                <p>Cultural geographer David Ley describes how moving abroad can be unsettling, even
                    for agents like the expatriate youths in this study who, in many cases, have
                    moved several times across the globe. In Shanghai, the teenagers and I discussed
                    their initial reactions to the decision to move, as well as the feelings that
                    leaving, arriving, and adjusting caused. Examining their reactions to their
                    parents’ announcement of the move to Shanghai and the students’
                    experiences of relocating, it becomes clear that their reflections during the
                    interviews revolve around their emotions. This finding is in agreement with
                    sociologist Christine Mattley’s (<xref rid="IDe9a18081-e8d7-45db-a58e-b8e27b9fe1b7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID75bf6d84-ac4d-4d3b-90ff-a464ec2082ee">2002, 365</xref>) argument that
                    feeling and reflecting are not opposed to each other, but that emotions provoke
                    and are also caused by reflection. Combining interactionist theories on emotion
                    and temporality, Mattley points out four dimensions we should consider when
                    thinking about the meaning of past emotions:</p>
                <p>We often endeavor to understand present emotions, through referencing our past
                    emotions and the usual assumption is that past emotions are given—that
                    they are real. However, that is not necessarily the case. Again, drawing on
                    Maines, Sugrue, and Katovich (<xref rid="IDe9a18081-e8d7-45db-a58e-b8e27b9fe1b7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID87d9739d-b41e-4620-bb44-c9df41c8ae8d">1983</xref>), it
                    is reasonable to suggest that moving backward, individuals may (1) symbolically
                    reconstruct past emotion such that they have meaning for the present emotion,
                    (2) note how past emotion structures and conditions emotions found in the
                    present, (3) recognize the implied objective emotional past, and (4) create a
                    mythical past emotion to explain the present one (<xref rid="IDe9a18081-e8d7-45db-a58e-b8e27b9fe1b7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9dc6fb5b-1f51-4a14-9834-776ba2ec4c51">Mattley 2002, 370</xref>).</p>
                <p>When discussing past emotions with the teenagers, keeping Mattley’s link
                    between emotions and temporality in mind helps me recognize not only the
                    students’ past emotional difficulties but also their present and ongoing
                    efforts to come to terms with their moving experiences. Interactionist theories
                    prove to be well-suited for explaining these feelings and the youths’ ways
                    of dealing with them because they have conceptualized emotions as emerging from
                    social acts within groups. In our case, this emergence takes place not only
                    within the family and among new friends in Shanghai, but also within the
                    interview situations. “Emotions originate and develop in social
                    relations” and are “sustained by group processes” (<xref rid="IDe9a18081-e8d7-45db-a58e-b8e27b9fe1b7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID719cdd01-67d2-4534-b94a-3eb8c02af60d">Mattley 2002, 365</xref>).
                    However, Mattley’s interactionist approach needs to be expanded to include
                    how emotions are experienced bodily. The anthropology of emotion addresses
                    feelings from different angles. John Leavitt (<xref rid="ID11dcdf99-529a-45a5-ba97-457b181756db" ref-type="bibr" id="IDea96572a-4041-43fa-979f-597a52bbc7bc">1996</xref>) summarizes the
                    discourse as a great divide between positions that explain emotions as being
                    both bodily and universal, and those that argue for interpreting emotions as
                    cultural categories that are used to communicate sociocultural messages.
                    Consequently, Leavitt argues that emotions should be understood as both—as
                    acts of communication and bodily experiences—and calls for
                    conceptualizations and representations of emotions in ethnographic work that
                    overcome this meaning/feeling divide. By treating students’
                    re-interpretations of past emotions during the interviews as cognitive and
                    communicative processes, I understand that the emotional events described are
                    also felt bodily, sometimes even to a physically challenging degree. </p>
                <p>The physical, cognitive, and communicative aspects of emotions that might arise
                    due to international relocation become evident during all my group discussions
                    and interviews. Eleven-year-old Allen from the USA, reflecting upon his last
                    move to Mexico, uses the narrative of “culture shock” to explain
                    this experience to his fellow students and myself. Sitting in his school’s
                    art room, he summarizes the implications of moving and the overwhelming emotions
                    it brings along, telling me that he “pretty much got sick.”
                    Likewise, Britta, the seventeen-year-old girl from Norway who just arrived in
                    Shanghai a few months before the interview, vividly remembers how strange
                    Shanghai felt to her:</p>

                    <speech id="speech67">
                        <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                        <p>Yeah, we were sitting. I just had such a sad image: we came, we were
                            really jetlagged. We come to the hotel, it smells weird, we get this
                            weird food, it is supposed to be toast and jam and they can’t even
                            make toast and jam. We were just like really depressed. We look out the
                            window. It is raining; we can’t even see the street. It is a cloud
                            blocking our window. It was just like, I’m gonna live here.</p>

                        <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                        <p>And after some days, it was like, clearing of the weather and it
                            wasn’t that bad and depressing. We saw nice apartments and
                            everything, so &lt;L&gt; we are like, okay.</p>
                    </speech>
                </p>
                <p>Britta describes her discomfort upon arrival as not being able to see, and
                    instead smelling and tasting the new environment. She relates emotions like
                    “feeling depressed” to the new sensory experiences, the
                    unfamiliarity and seeming unmanageability of the city. Other students, like
                    seventeen-year-old Karina, also comment on how lonely they felt in the beginning
                    or still feel when getting homesick. During an interview, the German-Czech
                    teenager shares:</p>
                <p>
                    <speech id="speech70">
                        <speaker>Karina</speaker>
                        <p><italic>And with the move. I don’t know. My mom feels terrible,
                            in the beginning felt terribly guilty for taking me away from Prague,
                            from all my friends. And I told her that it didn’t really bother
                            me that much. That’s what I thought at least in the beginning,
                            because we had moved so many times and I got used to it. I thought,
                            okay, I will find new friends here, and I will keep in touch with the
                            old ones. But now that I am here I think: “Crap! I am so far
                            away.” And in the first months I couldn’t stay in touch,
                            because Facebook didn’t work, nothing. I don’t know. I was
                            so alone here. […] On the other hand, you get used to it. I got
                            pretty flexible. But still, this void when you are gone. You don’t
                            have anyone here. Though you know what to expect, but still, you really
                            can’t handle it in the beginning.</italic>

                <p>Like this chapter’s introductory quote by David Ley (<xref rid="IDe9a18081-e8d7-45db-a58e-b8e27b9fe1b7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID47fe1e4f-8a9d-4232-9cb7-181bdc7ac1ad">2004, 157</xref>) suggests,
                    Karina’s narrative shows that even having moved internationally before
                    does not protect you from the inherent emotional turmoil of moving again. The
                    new place and the distance from friends “unsettle[s] agents with a
                    putatively global reach” (<xref rid="IDe9a18081-e8d7-45db-a58e-b8e27b9fe1b7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3ba84599-c77f-46b2-adca-b017b24d9fa2">ibid.</xref>). Karina also
                    shares how the moving experience strained her relationship with her mother.
                    Moreover, her story addresses how the lack of connections to her friends made it
                    difficult to cope with the emotional stress arising from the move.</p>
                <p>Karina’s classmate Bjorn, whose move from the German countryside to
                    Shanghai I discussed in Part I, Chapter 4 of this ethnography, likewise recalls
                    missing Germany and his friends in the beginning. However, one and a half years
                    after his move, he remembers his strategy in coping with these difficulties as
                    one of limiting his contact with his old friends.</p>

                        <p>The first months were difficult with Germany. Even if it sounds pathetic,
                            the only way to get through that is to maintain as little contact as
                            possible. The best is to not even use Facebook, but instead to write an
                            email every few weeks; they reply again in a week. Then you also have
                            something to talk about again. But you aren’t so much involved.
                            Because if you chat, time and again you kind of think that you were part
                            of it and then it reminds you of the old days and that’s really
                            bad.</p>

                    shock,” the lack of friends and family, and problems within the family that
                may be reenforced by the move, as well as an unfamiliar urban environment and new
                sensory experiences, all pose emotional challenges to them. Part III,
                    “Arriving,” explores the expatriate students’ strategies and ways
                of managing these experiences and emotions of powerlessness, loneliness, and
                unfamiliarity upon their arrival in Shanghai. </p>

      <p>This mental map depicting high-rise buildings, a large, elevated highway, and masses of
        people, was drawn by a girl at an international Singaporean school and illustrates how
        impressive and overwhelming arriving and living in Shanghai can be. The sixteen-year-old
        student annotated her map with the following caption:</p>
      <p>
        <disp-quote id="dispquote19">
          <p>The city, Shanghai, is continuously developing. Every day when I’m on the bus, looking
            outside the window, I can always find new infrastructures. The buildings are HUGE and
            the road is crowded. The map is what I see every day on the bus. It’s a busy Shanghai
            and is changing every day. People walk swiftly just like they are trying to catch up the
            beat of Shanghai.</p>
        </disp-quote>
      </p>
      <p>In my view, her drawing and annotation illustrate not only the unfamiliar urban
        environment, but also the radical changes, losses, and new encounters that teenagers face
        when moving to their new city of residence. It is the students’ ways of “catching up with
        the beat of Shanghai” and their new situation that this part of the book aims to examine.
        The following three chapters discuss how youths manage these difficulties and their new
        environment by outlining three important processes: exploring the city, establishing
        home-making practices, and building communities. </p>
      <p>The ethnographic material I present supports Fechter’s (2007b) observations of the
        importance of boundaries in expatriates’ lives and underpins her argument that their
        “insistence on fortifying spatial and social divides challenges notions of a transnational
        capitalist class which is claimed to be geographically mobile and cosmopolitan in outlook
        (Sklair [<xref rid="ID11c45c2d-2ae3-4cef-b483-8caa9cab7582" ref-type="bibr" id="ID72f9b6b3-526c-4c21-96b4-0955eb0a2719">2001</xref>] 2003; Hannerz [<xref rid="ID78b37526-f1fc-4399-8540-0e7da3b3f5e9" ref-type="bibr" id="ID126f8e0c-a056-4214-98ea-4bc34b406bef">1996</xref>] <xref rid="ID11c45c2d-2ae3-4cef-b483-8caa9cab7582" ref-type="bibr" id="ID77d188c1-16aa-46e2-86ac-da8043e50780">2001</xref>) […] such conceptions appear to be
        insufficiently grounded in ethnographic realities” (ibid., 80–81).</p>
      <p>Similar to Fechter’s findings, these chapters illustrate how, in the context of their
        mobile lifestyles, expatriate youths draw boundaries upon their arrival in Shanghai. Chapter
        1 argues that expatriate youths’ practices of managing the city are based on dividing it
        into expat and non-expat places. Chapter 2 demonstrates that their home-making practices are
        centered on both the fortified housing complexes where they live (and which separate their
        inhabitants from the outside world) and on staying connected with their family, friends, and
        former places of residence. Chapter 3 shows that the shared space of school is crucial for
        community-building processes and the friendships international students form. However, these
        community spaces also foster the performances of a collective expatriate identity in
        Shanghai with distinct values and practices that also enable the actor to distinguish him or
        herself from “locals” or those back “home.” </p>
      <p>Focusing on the subjective experiences children and teenagers face when moving, the
        everyday spatial and social practices presented in this part are regarded as complex
        emotional work (Hochschild [<xref rid="ID8a53018c-2ac4-49e6-8a3d-ef446c2e3941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID665e726d-5c70-4741-8a34-7de7c3c4c252">1983</xref>] 2003). This
        emotional work means coping with the moving experience through creating meaningful everyday
        social spaces—places of pleasure and consumption in the city, a space where a notion of home
        can unfold, a feeling of belonging to a school and/or expatriate community. Friends and
        various media—German online newspapers, social media such as Facebook, and communication
        technology like Skype—as well as family, food, material culture, and explorations of the new
        environment help the students deal with the move and develop ways to adjust to their new
        situation.</p>

        <p>A common way of gradually discovering Shanghai is experiencing the city on trips or
          through activities with family or friends. Learning to navigate Shanghai’s urban
          environment, as sixteen-year-old, self-confessed “villager” Bjorn’s comment suggests, is a
          crucial way of coming to terms with the stay abroad.</p>
        <p>The metropolis Shanghai has evoked and still evokes diverse images and its recent
          high-speed development startles every visitor. Donald and Gammack (<xref rid="ID9ca9bd4a-6a1a-4489-a47c-7656c2185c10" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6fd52dbb-3f98-4656-aa73-ded8c2526ee7">2007</xref>) describe Shanghai’s growth in

          <disp-quote id="dispquote21">
            <p>Infrastructure development in connection with Expo is unprecedented, and is
              positioning Shanghai for world competitiveness in several areas. A second airport, a
              new satellite city built on mud flats, a dock for cruise liners and Lupu Bridge, the
              world's longest arch bridge are some significant recent projects. The superfast Maglev
              train from the airport gives international arrivals an immediate sense of Shanghai's
              speed, while ongoing urban-rail development will see the six or seven lines that were
              in place in 2006 more than doubled by 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID9de5820b-d6a5-40cf-99e2-b65c4c7db4bb" rid="IDf5279545-3394-46dc-b9f1-4b117f937b5c">Chen 2005</xref>), and the total length
              of rail-track laid at present increase almost fourfold. The metro systems of London
              and Tokyo are two world-city benchmarks which Shanghai is seeking to exceed (Donald
              and Gammack 2007, 151).</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Donald and Gammack’s account of infrastructure projects in Shanghai links the city to the
          idea of speed, which is reminiscent of the “beat of Shanghai” that the Singaporean student
          described when annotating her mental map <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> (Figure
            4).</xref> When I started researching foreign youth in Shanghai, the projects described
          by Donald and Gammack in 2007 had all been completed and the city was in the middle of
          hosting the 2010 Expo. This mega-event had given “both a deadline and a unifying purpose
          to the city's debut preparations […] on a far grander scale than the construction of new
          stadia and exhibition halls typical of what other cities might produce. The entire city
          [was] being reconstructed—literally and metaphorically” (<xref rid="ID9ca9bd4a-6a1a-4489-a47c-7656c2185c10" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6402abfd-3535-465d-be44-923b40e52ba0">Donald and Gammack 2007, 154</xref>). </p>
        <p>Sometimes overwhelmed by the speed and contrasts of this rapidly developing mega-city, so
          fittingly exemplified by the 2010 Expo, I wondered how the teenagers made sense of
          Shanghai. By examining how the students explore their new urban environment, I show that
          both learning to navigate Shanghai and the city’s inherent sensorial impressions help the
          students manage their environment, by giving spaces a social meaning, they divide the city
          into manageable categories of what is “familiar” and “unfamiliar.”</p>

        <sec>
          <title>1.1. Navigating the city</title>
          <p>After the move to Shanghai, newcomers have to learn how to navigate the city. While
            buses hired by the schools provide transport to campus, students have to organize their
            transport to other destinations on their own. For my part, I depended largely on
            Shanghai’s continuously expanding network of subway lines, referred to locally as the
            “metro.” The subway provides a convenient mode of transportation, but closes at eleven
            p.m.—early for a city of its size. The teenage students, however, do not use the metro
            very often. </p>
          <p>This avoidance of the subway system is mainly due to the readily available school buses
            and taxis. With fares starting at RMB 12 (€1.32), or RMB 14 (€1.54) after the summer of
            2011, taxis are relatively inexpensive for an expatriate family income. Another
            preferred method of travel is the parents’ private car and driver, which are sometimes
            provided as a job benefit for senior-level expatriate employees. Both means of
            transportation are comfortable, but not without challenges. The following discussion on
            navigating through the city, recorded between three fourteen-year-old students, Keith, a
            boy from Singapore, Freda, a girl from Norway, and Vijay, a boy from India, shows that
            taking the taxi or the private car requires students to find ways to interact with local
            drivers, who usually do not speak English.</p>

          <p>This discussion illustrates that students can either rely on transportation provided by
            the school or the parents or find their own ways of moving through the city, for example
            by using text messaging services to communicate with taxi drivers. Despite these
            language barriers, the students still consider taxis easier to use than the metro. Some
            students own motor scooters, but use them predominantly in the direct vicinity of their
            housing areas. German school student Peter, for instance, owns a motor scooter, but soon
            gave it up as a means of daily transportation from the downtown apartment to school.
            When I asked him about it, he told me he had driven it three times to school, twice
            having minor accidents, one of which could have seriously harmed him, had he not been
            wearing his helmet. Driving oneself is therefore usually considered too dangerous. </p>
          <p>To further understand the expatriate youths movements through and relation to the city,
            I asked thirteen students at a local German school, three students at a British school,
            and seventeen students at a Singaporean school to record on paper their mental maps of
            everyday, important places in Shanghai. The results show that their visualizations
            follow a common pattern. The following table lists the places that were referred to most

          <p>The mental maps are clustered around important places such as school, home, and
            friends’ homes, and leisure spaces such as cafés, restaurants, or bars and clubs.
            Furthermore, iconic landmarks found their way onto the maps, probably to set the scene
            and mark the city on the map as Shanghai. Additionally, these city icons—such as the
            Oriental Pearl Tower or the Bottle Opener<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e168">66</xref>—may also
            be included in many of the drawings because they offer a point of entry to explore the
            city, or to identify with living in Shanghai. Eleven-year-old Allen, for instance,
            developed a fascination for Shanghai’s skyline. When asked if he has a favorite place in
            Shanghai, he replies with pride and enthusiasm: </p>
          <p>
            <speech id="speech90">

              <p><italic>The bottle opener. I have been up on the 91st floor in it and I had dinner

          <p>These mental maps provide insights into teenagers’ preferred spaces, forms of
            transport, and activities, as the following example, drawn by sixteen-year-old Olivia, a
            member of “the girls,” demonstrates <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> (Figure
            5).</xref></p>
          <p>Olivia’s map shows urban icons, such as the Oriental Pearl tower, and popular landmarks
            such as the Bund, the Yu-Garden, and the People’s Square. Concerning movement through
            and out of Shanghai, the drawing refers to metro stations (marked with a circled M), a
            car (in reference to a friend who lives outside the city), and the two city airports.
            The map presents the city as a space for satisfying individual needs. It revolves around
            places of consumption such as the Superbrand Mall, Plaza 66, the Fake Market, the
            shopping street Qipulu, and Pearl City. Furthermore, the student even includes specific
            brand stores such as Zara, H&amp;M, Mango, and Roxy on her map. While shopping here
            could be a family activity, the teenagers (and the girls in particular) enjoy going
            shopping with friends. Miller et al. (<xref rid="ID67055269-0e09-49eb-afb6-75fad85f83e7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID547ced08-cb14-4ede-9386-d97b92dd530e">1998, 101</xref>) suggest
            that teenagers not only visit such commercial spaces for consumption, but to express
            their “growing independence from their parents.” The school, friends’ houses (anonymized
            by the author), and Olivia’s own home are also seen as integral parts of the city.
            Restaurants, bars, and clubs form another large proportion. The student even names the
            clubs—Mural, M2 (Muse 2), Paramount, and Park 97—in an explanatory cloud. Her visual
            representation of the city, this fixing of her spatial practices, provides insights not
            only into her everyday life, but also into her image of the city, her aspirations about
            it, and what might be considered the stage for her own identity performances. Chapter 2
            of Part IV will further elaborate on these reciprocal relations of age identity and
            spaces when examining students’ nightlife practices.</p>
          <p>While the importance of visual impressions is immediately apparent in these student
            maps, considering the exact shapes of certain buildings such as the school, shopping
            malls, or urban landmarks, other sensorial impressions of the city are underrepresented.
            The next subchapter aims to explore the role other sensory experiences such as sounds,
            smells, and tastes play when exploring the new urban environment and making sense of
            Shanghai.</p>

          <title>1.2. Sensing the city</title>
          <p>When I tried to do what I had asked of so many students—to draw a map of all the places
            in Shanghai that I considered personally significant—I suddenly became aware of the
            skill with which some of the students were able to record their visual impressions on
            paper; I myself was unsure of how to draw certain details. Sensories are personal, not
            only in their interpretation but also in their use. When I started to write down city
            sounds, for example, much more came to mind: the metro beeping before closing its doors,
            the sound of the honking but otherwise silent electric scooters rushing by, the jingle
            playing when 7-11 doors glide open, the unpleasant noises of Shanghai’s innumerable
            construction sites, the shouting of the used electric appliance dealers (“kongtiao,
              diannao”),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e199">67</xref> the spoken words on the streets that I
            tried to untangle and sort into Shanghainese (the local dialect, understandable only to
            Shanghai natives, it seems) and Mandarin (the official, common language of the country).
            When waking up in the dark, these sounds would tell me whether it was already morning or
            still the middle of the night. I constantly made sense of my environment through sounds.
            And when the city’s voice became too exhausting, I put on my headphones, just like the
            students, to try to achieve some distance from it. Sometimes the common use of portable
            music players led to conversations about music. Bjorn, for instance, often introduced me
            to the bands he was listening to. The students and I talked about music but, unless it
            was about a concert in town (German DJ Paul Kalkbrenner, for example), or about choosing
            a certain nightlife space, we did not tie music and city sounds (or the blocking out of
            city sounds) together; the discussion rather served to stage certain subcultural
            preferences. Sounds are a vibrant part of the city experience and future inquiries into
            the Shanghai soundscapes are worthy of exploration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e203">68</xref>
            While sounds seemed central to my own navigation and understanding of the city, taste
            was the sense that featured predominantly in all of the students’ mental maps of
            Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Hongmei Road, for instance, the vertically-running street on the left of Olivia’s map
              <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> (Figure 5),</xref> is a small lane in the western
            part of Shanghai and popular among expatriates for its variety of foreign restaurants.
            The importance of places to eat in their expatriate life is visible on most of the
            students’ maps. The prominence given to foreign food, restaurants, and leisure spaces in
            their city maps shows that, for these students, taste and navigation in the city are
            linked. Scholars like David Howes (<xref rid="ID9a249598-4f9c-449e-842d-51dcb91d9b08" ref-type="bibr" id="ID678845c1-1587-4830-8673-55a14ed6dca5">2007</xref>) have pointed
            out the importance of all senses in making “sense” of both our environment and
            ourselves.</p>

            <disp-quote id="dispquote22">
              <p>Sensation is not just a matter of physiological response and personal experience.
                It is the most fundamental domain of cultural expression, the medium through which
                all the values and practices of society are enacted. To a greater or lesser extent,
                every domain of sensory experience, from the sight of a work of art to the scent of
                perfume to the savor of dinner, is a field of cultural elaboration. Every domain of
                sensory experience is also an arena for structuring social roles and interactions.
                We learn social divisions, distinctions of gender, class and race, through our
                senses. […] Sensual relations are also social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID58643e00-4d2f-48c5-8ac1-32a1cac1749b" rid="ID9a249598-4f9c-449e-842d-51dcb91d9b08">Howes 2007, xi</xref>).</p>

          </p>
          <p>Howes’s anthropological investigations explore how sensory experience can be structured
            and invested with meaning in many different ways across cultures. While this
            anthropological endeavor to study, compare, and theorize the cultural formation of the
            senses is fascinating, my own interest lies in how important senses are to exploring and
            experiencing urban spaces. There is obviously a difference between being in a place that
            we are able to experience at the same time with all our senses, and the virtual,
            imaginary places that are also present in our lives. Howes ([<xref rid="IDe8bedea8-b0ad-42fa-b95c-18085f16fe0f" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf2ed2e45-1a17-441f-928c-0d168736a36c">2005</xref>] 2006, 7) calls this “sensuous
            interrelationship of body-mind-environment” “emplacement.” Walmsley (<xref rid="ID4fcea73c-a75e-4f28-9eb9-203e58c0ec29" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7beee554-c8c2-4125-ac03-89c5e5a9b67e">2005</xref>) applies Howes’s concept of
            emplacement to different situations in Ecuador, for example to a market site:</p>
          <p>
            <disp-quote id="dispquote23">
              <p>An Ecuadorian market […] draws attention to the role of intersensoriality in the
                production of meaning through everyday lived experiences. Smells, sights, tastes,
                textures and sounds signify each other according to the particular context and the
                particular sensory knowledge of the individual experiencing them. This points to a
                central theme in the study of culture and the senses, which is that of ‘emplacement’
                  (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID49368945-dc1f-43cc-84a4-45fe5992744f" rid="ID4fcea73c-a75e-4f28-9eb9-203e58c0ec29">Walmsley 2005, 47</xref>).</p>
            </disp-quote>
          </p>
          <p>Walmsley uses the concept of emplacement to analyze the associations between place,
            identity, and sensory experience and to find out how racial categories in Ecuador are
            produced with all senses. Her ethnographic case in point shows how intersensorial
            experiences evoke feelings of both strangeness and belonging. These feelings play a
            fundamental part in processes of cultural (and in her case racial) identity negotiation.
            Tastes and smells are mostly discussed in terms of their relationship to food. As
            Walmsley (<xref rid="ID4fcea73c-a75e-4f28-9eb9-203e58c0ec29" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7e11ce64-c07e-490d-9060-9e88ffabcc5c">2005, 55</xref>) notes: “Sensory knowledge
            is developed through the sociality of food practices, which are produced through the
            sharing of tastes, smells and embodied culinary techniques.”</p>
          <p>In today’s Shanghai, the range of available tastes (as both sensory experience and
            culinary preference) is highly diverse. Shanghainese would constantly point this out to
            me by simply saying, “Shanghai dou you” (“Shanghai has everything”). With regard to
            cuisine, this may well be true. Shanghai contains German and French bakeries, Italian
            restaurants, American diners, numerous teppanyaki places, and all kinds of Chinese
            cuisine from spicy Sichuan dishes to northern Chinese noodles. International food stores
            carry almost everything the expatriate might miss <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">
              (Figure 6).</xref></p>
          <p>The students from the German school included their favorite Italian or American
            restaurants on their mental maps, while students from the Singaporean school in
            particular listed Korean or Japanese restaurants. Names of international chains like
            Starbucks are also included. Additionally, students embrace new tastes from non-Chinese
            sources, as a visit to a Japanese all-you-can-eat Sushi restaurant with a group of
            German students showed me. But as Walmsley (<xref rid="ID4fcea73c-a75e-4f28-9eb9-203e58c0ec29" ref-type="bibr" id="ID92d9c2e2-8b5c-4488-ba09-9ee2e5124c9d">2005, 55</xref>) already pointed out: “an
            individual’s sensory knowledge is never fixed or limited but always capable of adapting
            and expanding.” The senses, like these experiences in the foreign restaurants on the
            aforementioned Hongmei Road, connect the people in Shanghai with distant places.
            Walmsley also noted how this tendency applied to the stalls at the Ecuadorian market,
            which “also remind customers of other places, times, and people” (<xref rid="ID4fcea73c-a75e-4f28-9eb9-203e58c0ec29" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb8e110a3-d488-409d-9ede-f93e82efa6d7">ibid., 47</xref>). Olfactory experiences
            and memories of places go hand-in-hand. Food and dining practices therefore play a role
            in the process of home-making, as I will explore further in Chapter 2. Some of these
            dining places turned into spaces for regular gatherings that, over time, came to hold
            special meaning for those involved. “The girls,” for instance, frequently met at an
            Indian Restaurant on Hongmei Road. “The boys” or others were not allowed to accompany
            them, as it was a particular ritual for them to go there, to establish and deepen their
            friendships.</p>
          <p>In May 2011, when I had the opportunity to join students from the German School in a
            photo-walk project that a Geography teacher had set up, I chose to accompany “the girls”
            on their fieldtrip, an event that I described in more detail in Chapter 3.1 of Part I,
            to highlight my methodology. The group’s chosen research area was Tianzifang, a café,
            gallery, and souvenir shop district that was developed from a few lanes of old Shanghai
              houses<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e226">69</xref>. The students’ task was to
            photographically document globalization in the city. Although the project was designed
            around visual representations, other senses (and taste in particular), also played a
            role. The girls initially flocked to a café, which—according to them—sold the best
            milkshakes in town. When moving further through the labyrinth of lanes in Tianzifang,
            they pointed out restaurants at which they had eaten with their parents. They touched
            jewelry and clothes, and tried on hats in numerous shops. Tactile experiences thus
            influenced their navigation through the area <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"> (Figure
              7).</xref></p>
          <p>Although the visual engagement with the city that resulted from the Geography class’s
            photo-walk was particularly intense due to being a photographic analysis, it becomes
            clear that our experiences of urban spaces are always intersensorial.</p>
          <p>The method of mental maps, however, might be prone to overemphasizing visual forms of
            understanding and conceptualizing the city and might miss other sensory experiences
            possible within Shanghai. Occasionally, students tried to fit these non-visual
            perceptions on their maps, as the following example demonstrates <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> (Figure 8).</xref></p>
          <p>This student from a Singaporean school also includes iconic landmarks but places a
            strong emphasis on how she senses the city. Her map is filled with people, to
            demonstrate the crowdedness of the city, and images of cars and cramped, tall buildings
            to indicate the traffic and noise. The fumes behind the drawing of a car even evoke the
            smell of polluted air. Interestingly, the girl clearly juxtaposes the city against the
            area where her home and school are located, as the two arrows and the dividing line
            show. She annotates her sketches with “peaceful” and “quiet” on the private side, and
            with “noisy,” “crowded,” and “busy” on the other side. This second side is also labeled
            as “the city,” indicating that the school and home are not perceived as integrated parts
            of it. These maps produced by the expatriate youths support findings by scholars who
            have recently turned explicitly to exploring the role of sensorial experiences in
            cities. Geographer Melissa Butcher (<xref rid="ID77e4d190-3d3b-4e2d-9426-652afcf6ac3b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID86d65340-4b83-4f25-93d6-bc151d989bfc">2012</xref>), for example,
            studied the intersensorial experiences of young people of different backgrounds in
            Delhi. Her qualitative study on the relationship between the city of Delhi and its
            inhabitants demonstrates that sensory involvement with public spaces is used to
            affectively dissect Delhi into spaces of inclusion and exclusion, pleasure and
            discomfort, similar to the division on the Singaporean student’s map <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> (Figure 8).</xref> Butcher’s findings suggest that
            inhabitants link sensory experiences of the city on both an individual and cultural
            level to judgments about civil and uncivil behavior. The two maps shown in this chapter
            thus not only highlight the students’ everyday places, but also their perspectives on
            the city and their own role and position within it. With their maps, the two girls
            deliver a message to themselves, their peers, and to me as a researcher. Olivia’s map
            foregrounds the image of actively consuming the city through nightlife and shopping. Her
            image is opposed to the Singaporean student’s image of Shanghai, of retreating and being
            different from the noisy—and maybe even perceived as uncivilized—“rest of the city.” By
            contextualizing the drawings within the students’ ethnic backgrounds (Singapore and
            Belgium), one can see that the maps point to different positions toward and
            understandings of youth. However, their position towards me, a German researcher, also
            plays a role. The Belgian student demonstrates her urban “coolness,” while the
            Singaporean student may feel it necessity to point out that, although she is Asian, she
            feels estranged by China and its “noisy,” “crowded” cities.</p>

          <title>1.3 Concluding thoughts on managing life in the city</title>
          <p>The urban geographies students produced in their mental maps and explained in more
            detail in the interviews convey the continuous process of making sense of the city, not
            only in terms of navigation and sensory experience, but also in terms of positioning
            oneself within it—as consumers, inhabitants, or someone overwhelmed by the urban,
            sensorial landscape of Shanghai. Managing the city means managing everyday life and the
            migration experience, for instance by learning how to navigate between spaces of
            everyday practices and consumption, by giving spaces a social meaning, or by dividing
            Shanghai into a manageable, familiar area and “the rest of the city.” However, as
            cultural geographer David Crouch notes, “‘making sense’ does not equate making clear
            rationality but rather working our way through things, spaces, relations” (<xref rid="IDb671bc81-7a08-462b-b32c-416922c00484" ref-type="bibr" id="ID06f091f7-f8a3-4a83-8a91-38ac6210596a">2005, 31</xref>).</p>
          <p>The following chapter on housing spaces will further exemplify the divide between
            familiar areas and the rest of the city already introduced—there, the city and the gated
            communities are juxtaposed. Ways of home-making, including settling into the new house
            and various material practices, are discussed in detail. These behaviors are seen as a
            means of reconnecting with and linking former places of residence to Shanghai, thus
            creating a new network of “homes” through travel and social or broadcast media use. </p>

        <p>This chapter is concerned with the two meanings of the word “home” as it commonly
          describes both the domestic space we live in and “a space of imagined belonging” (Walsh
          2006a, 125).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e270">70</xref> Popular or common ideas of home often
          see these two spaces as coinciding. Home is frequently linked to one certain place,
          usually encompassing experiences of growing up or family life. It is therefore not
          surprising that the question of what home means for children growing up abroad has been a
          common topic in the literature that deals with expatriate youth from a TCK angle (Pollock
          and Van Reken [<xref rid="ID4f741152-ae97-41a8-8de1-c2a74cab6717" ref-type="bibr" id="ID22fe145f-a5f5-406c-bdff-14adc2b21d84">1999</xref>] 2009; Richter 2011; Franke
          2008), which I summarized and critiqued in the introduction. Parents and researchers alike
          seem extremely concerned with the implications of growing up without one such place.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e277">71</xref> Thus the original definition of a “TCK,” as I have shown
          earlier, is tied to a specific notion of belonging: “The TCK frequently builds
          relationships to all of the cultures, while not having full ownership in any. Although
          elements from each culture are assimilated into the TCK’s life experience, the sense of
          belonging is in relationship to others of similar background” (Pollock and Van Reken
            [<xref rid="ID4f741152-ae97-41a8-8de1-c2a74cab6717" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa17bde15-2992-463e-bde0-d7a01d4c1202">1999</xref>] 2009, 19).</p>

          notions of home and belonging among the youths she defines as “TCKs” on the basis of a
          qualitative study including a survey, in-depth interviews, and group discussions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e283">72</xref> Franke understands home as the interplay between three
          major connections: the connection to a place, which Franke links to Tuan’s (<xref rid="IDda560470-e338-43a2-939e-67f5360df612" ref-type="bibr" id="ID594b3da1-752a-4393-8a1e-a5506a300ddd">1974</xref>) concept of “topophilia,”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e287">73</xref> social connections, and material connections. Franke
          finds that additional variables also play a role in establishing notions of home for
          children growing up abroad. She therefore complexifies the interplay of place, social
          connections, and material connections by adding the following four aspects: a) “Emotive
          imaginations and time,” or, how long one stays connected with “emotive imaginations” such
          as feeling safe in a particular place, b) the family and its ties to both, c) the parental
          country, and d) the significance of language and culture (Franke <xref rid="ID3e454a5a-f6d4-4297-8f87-270f9888125d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID02154d1f-1c82-4f0b-895f-d3c67ddfc3c6">2008</xref>, 139–142). Franke reaches the
          following conclusion:</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote id="dispquote25">
            <p>This melting-pot of cultures results in a confusion over feelings of home […] Many
              TCKs have reported in the interviews that they find it hard to tell where home is.
              [...] Hence, it can be assumed that TCKs' notions of home are spatially distributed
              over different countries. They feel belonging [sic] to their parental country and, at
              the same time, feel at home in their current host country and identify with former
              host countries. Thus, TCKs have “multiple homes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID31599107-b5ac-4fc0-8968-144829d63fbb" rid="ID3e454a5a-f6d4-4297-8f87-270f9888125d">ibid., 143</xref>).</p>
          </disp-quote>
        </p>
        <p>Franke complements her idea of “multiple homes,” as seen in this quote, with the
          “imaginative idea” of home:</p>
        <p>
          <disp-quote id="dispquote26">
            <p>TCKs live in a permanent confusion about where they belong and where they should
              locate their home. One could say, they live in a compromise: They cannot adapt to
              every aspect of a certain place they momentarily live in, because they have
              experienced it differently somewhere else and thus have a greater ability to compare
              and weigh up [sic] the different aspects of home. The more mobile TCKs are, the more
              abstract their idea of home becomes. They generally concentrate their notions of home
              on the more continuous factors in their lives, such as the family, relatives or the
              parental country. Thus, a TCK's home is rather an imaginative idea than an actual
              location (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID197a347e-6748-482d-8000-f6e4460c5895" rid="ID3e454a5a-f6d4-4297-8f87-270f9888125d">ibid., 148</xref>).</p>

        </p>
        <p>Franke’s findings and her conceptualization of home as an imaginative idea rather than an
          actual location for children growing up on the move reinforces the original TCK
          definition. However, instead of taking this definition and Franke’s related findings as a
          priori for the international children and teenagers in Shanghai, I prefer to take a closer
          look at their own ideas of home.</p>
        <p>In order to understand the expatriate students’ perspectives and what “home” means for
          these privileged migrant youths who are so often on the move, this chapter tightly links
          the teenagers’ and their family’s housing and material practices concerned with
          home-making to broader concepts and imaginings of belonging.</p>
        <p>The first part of this chapter discusses gated community living—the reality for most
          expatriate youths in Shanghai—based on data I collected during interviews, visits, and my
          own two-week-long stay in such a community. The second part addresses material practices
          within the site of the home and pays attention to objects, food, and the practices
          associated with them, based on further interviews, a student’s photo, and my own visits to
          the youths’ houses. After focusing on these housing and material practices in Shanghai, I
          then examine, in the third part of the chapter, the teenagers’ (trans)local networks and
          their ties to places beyond the city—the “imaginative ways in which places are drawn
          together or kept apart” (<xref rid="ID633077cc-2fb1-4b42-9d81-5e9fd48a5f52" ref-type="bibr" id="ID92795ba7-6fe7-47e6-b7b1-aa5aa4479a43">Robinson 2010,
          16</xref>)—through in-depth interviews. This part is concerned with places where the
          teenagers have lived before, regularly visit, or are emotionally attached to—their network
          of homes. The last section of the chapter further discusses the youths’ conceptions of
          home and belonging and juxtaposes them with academic arguments.</p>

            and my discussions with teenagers has shown (<xref rid="ID64b61fb0-3396-4945-b7d4-618e1ac795bf" ref-type="bibr" id="ID608c5ae4-5d40-4baf-856a-7585adf6be89">Sander 2014</xref>). The desire to combine
            security—to protect the private sphere, be protected from the “other,” and maintain a
            retreat from traffic, noise, and air pollution—with a familiar standard of living is
            important to expat parents. Furthermore, the neighborhood, with its many foreigners,
            offers a form of controlled heterogeneity that many of the adults I interviewed found
            appealing. The mothers I interviewed during my fieldwork in 2007 reported that, in the
            compounds, the neighbors were easier to meet because they were all in the same situation
            and had common interests. For the stay-at-home-mothers, the gated communities were
            particularly important, because, unlike their children who went to school, they did not
            have a zone for establishing friendships (<xref rid="ID64b61fb0-3396-4945-b7d4-618e1ac795bf" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc2bc53af-73e4-4e90-baa5-b863d2aaee63">ibid.</xref>). Willis and Yeoh (<xref rid="ID2e7aa643-3e28-43ae-a9ff-70d4828bac67" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4206b737-d652-4e48-b376-60672a76ef24">2002, 558</xref>), whose work examines
            expatriates in Hong Kong, understand the compound as the “key to the development of
            social networks,” despite also pointing out that it is a highly gendered space that
            brings mainly expatriate full-time housewives together. Parents also consider their
            children’s needs when choosing a housing option, for example, the availability of green
            spaces and the assurance of safe journeys to school. Many families therefore decide to
            settle in the vicinity of a school, at the outskirts of Shanghai. The schools make this
            choice easier by providing helpful information. For example, the German school provides
            an annotated map that lists, among other things, exact numbers of enrolled students that
            live nearby.</p>
          <p>Although the decision to opt for a refuge from the city is often linked to the safety
            and wellbeing of children (<xref rid="ID64b61fb0-3396-4945-b7d4-618e1ac795bf" ref-type="bibr" id="ID630b1197-be2e-4ad5-9af1-659c6512dd42">Sander 2014</xref>), no
            research to my knowledge exists on young people’s perspectives and experiences related
            to that decision. My own fieldwork, however, shows that children usually benefit from
            the opportunity to roam around that is afforded by such spaces. Geographer Gill
            Valentine’s (<xref rid="IDc071a2b6-0942-415f-9916-09d4717eb081" ref-type="bibr" id="ID71506ed1-4e92-41c6-93a4-8f50208379e3">2003, 38</xref>) suggestion that the
            spatial experiences of children in the contemporary North are ‘‘strongly circumscribed
            by adults” fittingly describes expatriate children’s reality. Used to this
            circumscription, they do not necessarily experience the compound walls as confining, but
            rather find that their confines provide them with a certain degree of freedom in
            everyday life. To the younger children, the compound is a zone where they can simply
            move around on their own (<xref rid="ID64b61fb0-3396-4945-b7d4-618e1ac795bf" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7ca40566-3a26-4fec-8ee2-f18fa99a622b">Sander 2014</xref>).</p>
          <p>For teenagers, however, this positive aspect of “fenced freedom” becomes obsolete as
            they are gradually allowed to move through the city on their own. For them, the
            compound’s meaning turns from one which promotes this freedom, as experienced by younger
            children, to one of isolation and boredom (<xref rid="ID64b61fb0-3396-4945-b7d4-618e1ac795bf" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3bc63edd-a900-4863-ad6f-0adebed76d31">see Sander 2014</xref>). German teenager

          <p>Bjorn does not share the children’s positive evaluation of the compound as a space to
            roam free, but mainly sees it as a space that isolates him “from the Chinese world.” The
            desire for transgressing these spatial boundaries, which is also linked to a wish to
            explore city spaces and to participate in activities associated with youth—such as
            clubbing—will be explored further in Part IV, “Living.”</p>
          <p>The youths also cannot identify with the notion of community that the gated estates
            provide for adult expatriates. In contrast to the mothers I interviewed, teenaged Mia
            explains: </p>

                  compound is a little old and not really nice anymore. And by now it’s not like
                  that anymore. Back then it was really like that. You had several people who you
                  knew and you always did things together and so on. I used to live there. But now I

          <p>Besides pointing out possible changes in the compound, Mia’s quote demonstrates that
            growing up also alters an individual’s perspective on gated community living. Her social
            interactions moved beyond the realm of the compound, as she became interested in and
            allowed to enter new spaces. Of her current gated community, Mia openly says “I don’t

          <p>Returning to the issue of isolation addressed by Bjorn above, it is interesting to link
            his observations—“some of them really withdraw”—to Anne Coles’ (<xref rid="IDfccf4974-8c50-497b-975b-6b3ce6e68c35" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe5102b75-f760-453a-a135-6c6dc3337173">2008</xref>) survey on the social lives of
            British diplomatic families living abroad. Her work shows that spouses of diplomats have
            considerably more contact with other diplomats and expatriates than with nationals of
            the host country. Although patterns of socializing vary, there is a correlation between
            gated community living and less socializing with locals (Coles <xref rid="IDfccf4974-8c50-497b-975b-6b3ce6e68c35" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2fe2ebc6-819e-428e-9220-e080dfd2d5f0">2008</xref>, 132). Gated communities are
            therefore vital to the process of drawing boundaries. Bjorn’s descriptions also support
            anthropologist Fechter’s argument that expatriates—in her case, in Jakarta—“are
            fundamentally concerned with the production and negotiation of boundaries” (<xref rid="ID450c307e-721c-49c9-822f-cf213ba55ed4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID08c3001c-a2df-438a-be1d-92ccd1c572e7">Fechter 2007b, 61</xref>). Fechter does
            not simply link the construction of boundaries to a fear of the “other,” but to the loss
            of control and “expatriates’ discomfort with their bodily visibility as ‘Whites’ in a
            predominantly Asian society” (<xref rid="ID450c307e-721c-49c9-822f-cf213ba55ed4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1961acbb-07b9-4010-a698-2210185daaa7">ibid., 62</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e438">78</xref> Living in a suburban enclave sometimes means keeping

          <p>Don’s story is one example of how the thick walls around the communities are symbolic
            of the barriers towards Chinese society that expatriates’ practices contribute to. It
            also shows how many of the teenagers perceive the compound not only as guarded but also
            as restrictive. </p>
          <p>In the previous chapter, I highlighted how teenage students perceive and manage the
            divide between the city and familiar spaces. Gated community living strengthens this
            divide. In the August 2010 issue of Shanghai Family, for instance, a mother is quoted as
            commenting on life in a compound: “Although the French Concession gives you a better
            flavor of Shanghai, being here is like being at home” (<xref rid="ID7f631b50-2d94-493f-aecb-655b3634da95" ref-type="bibr" id="ID45f2edfb-cb26-48af-9cbf-d82532970d5c">Sparling 2010, 11</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e541">81</xref> Here, home is juxtaposed to the French concession
            representing the city of Shanghai and its semi-colonial past. Bjorn also commented on

          <p>This juxtaposition, again, shows how Shanghai itself often plays a marginalized role in
            daily expatriate life and is experienced as a backdrop to their otherwise “Western
            world.” The gated communities do not form part of the city. For most teenagers, the city
            outside the gates not only embodies noise and dirt <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> (see
              Figure 8),</xref> but also excitement and coolness, as will be shown in Part IV,
            Chapter 2, on nightlife activities. The city with its global nightscapes invites the
            students to transgress borders like the compounds’ walls and to explore spaces that
            enable them to establish an emotional connection to Shanghai. Focusing on the divide
            that Bjorn relates to gated community living, however, I argue that compound living
            makes it difficult to settle and build a relationship with the city, ultimately
            preventing Shanghai from becoming “home.” The gated communities in Shanghai form a space
            where expatriates see themselves as cosmopolitan, while the “other” is essentialized and
            kept outside. Expatriate youths in particular see gated communities mainly as spaces
            that disconnect them from the urban environment of Shanghai and thus impair their
            emplacement in the city.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, students also contemplate the positive aspects of gated community living,
            such as the short distance from school or their perceived safety, and point out that
            these gated estates host their homes—places they enjoy, as the following quote from a
            conversation with three of “the boys” (Don, Bjorn, and Alex) shows:</p>

          <p>“Home is a process and, as such, involves continual practices of home-making to be felt
            and experienced,” argues human geographer Katie Walsh (<xref rid="ID37c27be2-f695-4689-8682-fd81f096bc39" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc9aa443f-e33e-4564-a2f9-7a149ca7facc">2011, 516</xref>), based on her
            ethnographic research on the home-making practices of male British migrants in Dubai, a
            claim echoing the earlier work of Miller (<xref rid="ID2fdf9c53-7dad-40ba-94be-a748b1693e6d" ref-type="bibr" id="IDae0fc9fe-2943-4d70-8277-faa7cb1f80c3">2001</xref>) and Blunt and Dowling (<xref rid="IDd6977d02-53d7-4580-a3f1-4e08f81db366" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc8a2034a-c691-49e0-8e02-1d2443928684">2006</xref>). These practices are
            particularly important to expatriate teenagers, for many of whom home as “a site of
            everyday life” may differ from actual feelings and spaces of belonging. In Shanghai,
            this process of home-making is often based on material objects, food, and the
            connectedness of these objects with family practices.</p>

                  at how much stock I put in material objects. I was embarrassed, ashamed to admit
                  how much they meant to me. It wasn’t so much the individual objects that I grieved
                  for, rather it was what they represented as a whole; for me their value resided in
                  where they were from. Together, collectively, these objects told the story of who
                  I was, and this, as I gradually began to understand, was contingent on where I had
                  lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID553f3e82-c187-4d99-8495-5d2f916972e4" rid="IDff78f495-c38a-4a6e-a5a0-3d0678d6d1b1">Burns 2011, 367</xref>).</p>

            <p>In a very personal piece, Maureen Burns (<xref rid="IDff78f495-c38a-4a6e-a5a0-3d0678d6d1b1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe4d7561c-e006-4559-bc33-d497a9f3ae0b">2011</xref>) discusses her own
              expatriate childhood experience and links it to a few theoretical reflections from the
              angle of visual and material culture studies. Her article shows how any sort of
              documentation as a means of representing and articulating identity is a common
              strategy among migrants to deal with moving. Burns remembers the loss of a container
              shipment that included all her belongings when she moved to the USA, for college.
              Feeling “stripped bare,” Burns recalls that she had almost nothing left “to
              communicate a whole sense of self” (<xref rid="IDff78f495-c38a-4a6e-a5a0-3d0678d6d1b1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDef620476-87f4-49ac-adc3-49463f9b284f">ibid., 366</xref>) after
              the shipment went missing. Having only the clothes and jewelry she wore and the things
              from her suitcase left, she remembers how the rings she wore during the trip, which
              she had collected throughout her many stays abroad, “became great conversation pieces
              that simultaneously piqued other’s interest and communicated [her] experiences.” She
              sees such objects as “containers” of her life that protect her personal history,
              “ensuring against the losses of the past” when symbolically displaced (<xref rid="IDff78f495-c38a-4a6e-a5a0-3d0678d6d1b1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID354a56f1-2a31-46db-a4e8-08e1fab557da">ibid.</xref>).</p>
            <p>Anthropologist Heather Hindman (<xref rid="IDa34b19e5-02ff-44ac-a361-b46b6fe13502" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3e4ffa23-68fb-4db6-8ee8-ffe3f7d42f94">2009b, 676</xref>)
              describes how the expatriate women she studied in Kathmandu strategically shopped for
              specific art objects to use “as means of transferring knowledge and status between
              locations.” The items displayed in their homes, similar to the rings Burns chose to
              wear, invited the opportunity to communicate experiences and share stories. As Hindman
              theorizes, “the objects expatriates collect are actants in the social drama of
              Expatria, lurking in freeze-dried form, ready to spring to life in a new location to
              impart status to their possessors” (Hindman <xref rid="IDa34b19e5-02ff-44ac-a361-b46b6fe13502" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0358df14-a466-4934-a5d6-7495604b0387">2009b, 676</xref>–677).</p>
            <p>Such meaning-laden objects, including furniture from former stays, were present in
              many of the students’ homes. Most expatriate families take advantage of their
              employer’s financial support and ship their belongings around the world. A certain
              number of container shipments are usually included in the so-called packages that the
              employing organizations provide as part of their contracts.</p>
            <p>In Shanghai, Mia, whose case I use here to exemplify the role material culture plays

            <p>When, during my last stay in June 2012, I visited Mia at home, I moved through a big,
              airy house located on a green compound. Upon entering the villa, my attention was
              immediately drawn to the walls of the hallway and living room, which were decorated
              with Chinese calligraphy and a large framed painting displaying the harbor of their
              German hometown. The painting, like those of English landscapes that Walsh (<xref rid="ID4aa92bc8-9ac2-4ab2-901c-046cc2713454" ref-type="bibr" id="ID084e2bbf-861a-42ca-b95b-e3252d92ef74">2006a</xref>) found in British
              expatriate homes in Dubai, seemed to support the residents’ claim to belonging
              elsewhere. The living room also housed several custom-made pieces of furniture in the
              modern Chinese style, which I came across in several expatriate homes, as well as in
              advertisements in the local expatriate press. These pieces seem to be favored objects
              for capturing memories of Shanghai. Mia’s room upstairs sported a similar collection
              of objects and images, if more intimate than those downstairs. It is therefore not
              surprising that, when I asked the teenagers from the German school to send me an image
              documenting what “home in Shanghai” means to them, Mia sent me the following photo of
              her room <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11"> (Figure 11).</xref>
            </p>
            <p>Stuffed with magazines, books, clothes, photos, and souvenirs, Mia’s room seems to

                    few things behind. I have things, my goodness, which I really don’t need
                    anymore. If I moved right now and opened a second room, I would leave a lot of
                    things behind, but would not throw them away. [...] But I could not live in an
                    empty room. Absolutely not. I think if I moved without my stuff, nevertheless,
                    after a month at the most, my room would be full. I don’t know, I just need

              belongings and, consequently, the reminders and markers of who she is. Mia’s room
              shows that some items, for instance the Shanghai pillow, might have been purchased
              with the future in mind, like the objects belonging to Hindman’s actors in Nepal,
              “ready to spring to life in a new location” (<xref rid="IDa34b19e5-02ff-44ac-a361-b46b6fe13502" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc8b6e71d-496d-4ae2-bce7-7f2a675831f6">Hindman 2009b, 676–677</xref>). While
              Hindman stresses how such memorabilia “impart status to their possessors,” I see them

            <title>Food</title>
            <p>In her article “The Taste of Home,” Elia Petridou (<xref rid="ID054d1d07-3e81-4020-8378-af8c8ba781fc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc97a1348-dd86-422c-bd0b-411bede4a5ba">2001, 89</xref>) studies Greek students’
              culinary practices in London, showing how food can create “the experience of home as a
              sensory totality.” By exploring food culture, Petridou sees home as located “away from
              its physical structures of the house” but still linked to the material world,
              understanding it “as a practice and a combination of processes through which its
              inhabitants acquire a sense of history and identity” (<xref rid="ID054d1d07-3e81-4020-8378-af8c8ba781fc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf40f1e2c-9621-4c58-9991-c9a909d7b4b4">ibid., 88</xref>). I can relate to the
              importance of food in feeling at home. While I enjoyed exploring my Chinese
              surroundings by dining out in local restaurants, eateries, noodle shops, and street
              food stalls, I occasionally prepared “home” food at home.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e775">88</xref> However, I was startled to find that, for many students, these
              clear place/taste relationships were dissolving, or had even turned the other way
              around. While I had learned from the students’ maps and participant observation that
              the teenagers enjoyed eating out in Western-style restaurants, I initially
              underestimated the role of the ayi,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e781">89</xref> the maid or

            <p>The students experience Chinese food at home, prepared by the family’s maid, and the
              city of Shanghai therefore often provides the international food they crave. Of course
              some of the students enjoy their native cuisine at home, as an ayi working for several
              foreign families told me. Although she would cook Chinese food two or three times per
              week, she was particularly proud of her skills preparing pizza, making spinach pies,
              and baking whole wheat bread. Not in all households, however, is the preparation of
              meals left to the ayi. After one interview with three of “the boys,” Bjorn made
              everyone jealous by saying that his mom was awaiting him at home, along with homemade
              Spaghetti Bolognese. Apparently this was exceptional, as many expatriate families rely
              on their maid for food preparation. Generally, “home” food is noticeably missed. Paul,
              who grew up in the United States, for instance, would crave Slurpees (iced, flavored
              drinks). Most of the German boys commented on missing kebabs, or food they associated
              with their grandmothers’ cooking, such as potato salad or roast beef. The category of
              home food, however, becomes questionable when Chinese dishes become an integrated part
              of the diet at home and “home food”—Western dishes—part of dining out in the city. For
              expatriate students, food therefore rather relates to broader ideas of home, as Mia’s
              account on the relationship between certain food smells and feelings of being at home

            <p>Certain practices surrounding food, however, can encourage the process of
              home-making, as Bjorn’s pride in his mother’s Bolognese shows. The fact that his
              mother—and not the maid—prepared the dish was also crucial to its value.</p>

            <title>Family life and settling in </title>
            <p>Mia’s, Bjorn’s, and their peers’ experiences show that material culture plays a
              significant role in making home a meaningful place for teenagers’ everyday lives.
              Further details from Mia’s case highlight the reciprocal relationship between
              materiality and human practices in the process of turning a new place into a home.</p>
            <p>Mia, who has moved several times in her life, always draws a lot of strength from her
              family. She and her two siblings have very close relationships and it seems to me that
              shared family activities are an important coping mechanism for her. This impression is
              confirmed when she tells me about her struggles when her father and older sister had
              to leave Shanghai due to job obligations and college. Mia, her mother, and brother
              stayed on in Shanghai, however, for Mia to finish her last year of school. During our
              interview a year later, she recalls:</p>

                <p><italic>There was a difficult moment when we came to know that my father had to
                    move. That really wasn’t great. Especially in the beginning, because my father
                    and sister both stayed in Germany. And the three of us came back to move into
                    this house [in Shanghai]. We had lived in a different house before. That was no
                    easy time. I was really… The first month, every evening, I was always sad, I
                    cried a lot. It was okay during the day when I was at school, but [difficult] in
                    the evenings at home. Our family life changed a lot. We all used to sit around
                    the dinner table, and now we are only three, and usually someone is not there.
                    Well, it really did change a lot. Sometimes we have to make plans: Okay, let’s
                    all go out for dinner together, so we can all talk for hours again. Otherwise
                    you talk, sure, but only two of us, rarely all three.</italic>

            <p>Mia misses her father and sister, but she also misses the communal dinner as a family
              routine that is crucial to rendering the place of residence into home. When I inquire
              about her strategies for dealing with the new situation at home, she explains: </p>

                <p><italic>Well, since we have become such a small family, I plan a lot of
                    activities. So I am really out a lot, simply because... Well, I used to be happy
                    to be home alone once in a while, because it so rarely happened. If you are five
                    people, it rarely happens. And now I don’t enjoy being home alone, then I am
                    like, “Okay, what do I do now?” So when I am home alone I usually go downtown or
                    just do something with friends. […] My calendar is actually always full. That’s
                    sort of my strategy. Well, sure, I also think a lot. But sitting at home all the
                    time, everything is kind of crashing down around you the whole time, but you
                    can’t do anything about it, and you’re just sitting around stupidly.</italic>

            <p>Since these dinners no longer convey the sense of home, Mia prefers to spend time
              outside with her friends, establishing new practices of home-making for herself in
                Shanghai.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e871">94</xref> Likewise, many of the expatriate
              students learn to live with fathers who are often absent. Eleven-year-old Allen, for
              instance, only sees his father on the weekends, when he returns from his work site in
              a minor Chinese city. </p>
            <p>It is evident that the expatriate teenagers’ material practices of creating “home”
              are continuous negotiations, not only of home as a site, but also of processes of
              emplacement in the city and of larger understandings of belonging, as Walsh succinctly
              phrases it: “Domestic materialities can play a highly significant role in migrants’
              negotiation of geographies of belonging, residence, landscape and place” (<xref rid="ID37c27be2-f695-4689-8682-fd81f096bc39" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc1001f6c-b462-4202-bc56-89dea9f9c737">2011, 516</xref>). Basu and Coleman
              argue that material culture shows how migrants not only change their place, but also
              “their place within the ‘world’ they have entered” (<xref rid="IDab73be29-a275-4796-b96a-42896febe384" ref-type="bibr" id="ID78dcac70-4691-4e8f-9b70-5e78e6967c89">2008, 324</xref>). Having laid open the
              connections between belongings and belonging, the next section explores the latter in

          <p>The questions of belonging and home are central topics in migration studies and have
            led to various conceptualizations. Researchers across different disciplines have
            analyzed and conceptualized transnational migrants’ practices and understood migrant
            forms of belonging, often “through abstracted spatial tropes” (<xref rid="ID4aa92bc8-9ac2-4ab2-901c-046cc2713454" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9d135ea9-a729-4fea-a870-a51f52a2604b">Walsh 2006a, 124</xref>), putting emphasis
            on the state of “in-betweenness” and the multiple ties migrants maintain. For instance,

          <p>With the rise of multiple connections, Simon Turner (2008, 1050) argues that
            “transnational migration and diasporic communities contain an inherent spatial tension,
            as populations no longer ‘fit’ their territory—belonging to several places at once.”
            Other concepts using “abstracted spatial tropes” to understand the complex processes of
            linking places and people across borders and the migrant’s “position” in these networks
            include “transnational social spaces” (Pries 2001), “ethnoscapes” (Appadurai 1996), and
            the “third space” (Bhabha [<xref rid="IDded2f030-5c53-49c3-931f-346deab63529" ref-type="bibr" id="ID08a2450e-bdf8-4bd5-b840-2d24875eb8d3">1994</xref>] 2009).</p>
          <p>Katie Walsh (2006a, 124) succinctly outlines the discourse on migration and home,
            recalling that, at the end of the twentieth century, theorists described “contemporary
            social life and individual experience that privileged global movement.” Summarizing the

            Robertson et al. (1994), Walsh proposes that “we live in a world of ‘flows’ and
            societies in which identities are destabilized and detached from place,” but points out
            that ideas which “privilege movement over attachment” have since been contested and
            criticized for “their insensitivity towards the continued importance of place, dwelling,
            and home.” According to Walsh, Geraldine Pratt’s (1992) reflections on the “problematic
            nature of the hierarchical dualism of mobility/dwelling established by these
              literatures,”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e891">95</xref> inspired theorists such as Brah

            and Ahmed et al. (2003) to understand home and migration as being interdependent
            (ibid.). Increasingly, scholars—Walsh (2006a, 124) refers to Lamb (2002) and the
            geographers Jackson, Crang, and Dwyer (2004); the ethnographer Englund’s (2002)
            post-globalist approach that was discussed earlier could be added—now call for research
            on processes of migration that is “’grounded’ through attention to the ways such
            processes are locally lived and produced” (Walsh 2006a, 124). This critique of earlier
            conceptualizations of the impact of migration on belonging that disregard the role of
            place also echoes Avtar Brah’s warning that “the very strong association of notions of
            diaspora with displacement and dislocation means that the experience of location can
            easily dissolve out of focus” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID94edf8e4-8d28-4ed5-9db1-d7ddac475e56">1996</xref>, 180).</p>
          <p>The two preceding parts of this chapter have therefore stressed the experiences and
            practices revolving around the concrete site of the home and its embeddedness in the
            larger context of gated community living in Shanghai, with its inherent demarcation from
            local society. But how are these practices of settling in and demarcation related to the
            movement of expatriate youths and global, flowing, and shifting connections and
            identifications? The final section of this chapter consequently investigates students’
            own perspectives on belonging by investigating their relationships with places and
            people beyond Shanghai, and to abstract or imagined ideas or emotions as emerging from
            their experiences of mobility and home-making. </p>
          <sec>
            <title>Talking about home and belonging</title>
            <p>Following the importance given to home and belonging in previous research, I
              discussed the topic during all interviews with students. During these conversations, I
              sometimes feared that the term “home” referred to a quite prescriptive idea and that
              students would feel obliged to position themselves or state alliances to nationality
              or places of “origin.” However, I still considered “home,” as a part of everyday
              vocabulary, the best choice. I then tried to open up the discussion by asking not only
              “Where is home for you?” but by further asking: “What do you usually reply when
              someone asks you where you are from?” I initiated discussion following these questions
              and asked the students how they felt about them, and whether these were easy or
              difficult questions to answer. It became apparent that, for many students, the answers
              heavily depended on who would ask them, a trend that points out how performative and
              relational the politics of home are. The following section presents these interviews
              and a discussion in the form of mind maps that were produced at the German school. The
              students were asked to discuss their ideas of “Heimat” (belonging/home) in written
              form, in class. These mind maps show that home is a term which brings about many
              associations and emotions <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12"> (Figure 12).</xref></p>
            <p>Covering a variety of issues, the students refer to the places where they grew up and
              “childhood,” as well as “memories” and “experiences” in general. They list “family”
              and the presence of relatives and pets. Likewise, friends feature prominently in all
              four sketches, and are linked to comments on community and trust. “School” also finds
              its way onto one of the posters. </p>
            <p>The teenagers also discuss sensorial experiences, such as climate and food, and
              familiar cultural practices, such as festivals and language. Houses and apartments as
              well as objects such as photos, videos, and music appear on the maps, too.</p>
            <p>“Heimat” also evokes comments on patriotism, birthplace, nationality, nation states
              (“Germany, China”) and mega-events like the World Cup (“Nation stands behind its
              country roots for it”).</p>
            <p>Moreover, all the sketches display discussions on media, listing social networks and
              services such as Facebook, Gowalla, Twitter, Myspace, and forms of communication such
              as VoIP (Voice over IP) and instant messenger platforms. Next to these ways of staying
              in touch with friends and family, German online media is also mentioned as a way that
              many of the students relate to their country of citizenship <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13"> (Figure 13).</xref>
            </p>
            <p>Emotions such as feeling accepted or safe play a prominent role in their written
              discussions of home, with students noting that home is “where I can be myself,” with
              “people who really know you,” or that “home is where the heart is.” Some remarks refer
              to individual aspects of and ideas about belonging, such as “everyone imagines home
              differently.” </p>
            <p>“Moving” is mentioned in connection to the question “Does ‘home’ change?” Other
              comments simply inquire “no home?” or “homeless?” On one poster, students ask “What is
              homeless?” and answer their own question with “when you feel you are wanted nowhere
              and have no relation to any specific place” and “neither place nor people.”</p>
            <p> “Heimat” evokes various associations and questions among students. The students make
              it clear that it is something they continuously negotiate and relate to “childhood,”
              “family,” “friends,” “nationality,” “media,” “everyday practices,” “experiences,”
              “memories,” and “feelings.” It seems that, through moving, contemplating the notion of
              home becomes even more relevant. The next sections therefore look at several
              individual students’ thoughts about and negotiations of their subjective ideas of
              home.</p>

            <p>Home is often associated with stability and continuity, as the following quote from

                    and you say “oh.” The style of life, there is a big change in the style of

            <p>However, due to the fact that continuity and “everything staying a certain way” is
              not a given for children moving transnationally, many of my interviewees have
              difficulty pointing out what home is to them. Japanese student Kazuo, whom I
              interviewed at the Singaporean school, explains:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="speech131">

                    I have no home in Japan. So, I cannot answer my home is in Japan. In Japan, I

            </p>
            <p>Like Kazuo, the international students with their transnational ties and connections
              to multiple locations have to negotiate the term and find a way to go beyond
              prioritizing one place over the other. In the eyes of expatriate youths, home is
              nothing fixed or easy to define.</p>
            <p>Some students deal with the problem of defining home by claiming home as “back home.”
              For instance, eleven-year-old Allen, who has already lived in several places, sees his

            <p>Karina and Allen both actively maintain their ties to what they consider their true
              “home,” Prague and the house in the USA. Shanghai is only a transitory space to them.
              Karina not only defines Prague as her home, but also Shanghai as a place where she
              tries to spend “as little time as possible.” She points this out during a follow-up
              interview that I conduct with her one year after her initial move to Shanghai. Karina
              had difficulties with the “homing” process and, even after one year, limits her
              relationship to Shanghai to seeing it as merely an aspect of her father’s job.
              However, just before the interview, she had returned from a summer in Prague and was
              really missing her family and friends there. In short, for some students, home is
              connected to “elsewhere,” to necessary travel, and to missing people and places.</p>
            <p>Keeping the migratory experiences of the young actors in this study in mind, it is
              not surprising to find that their transient relationship with Shanghai might make it
              difficult for some of these students to consider it home. Tamara, who was twelve years
              old when we talked during a group discussion at a British school, explained: </p>

            <p>For Tamara—who grew up in Singapore and China—the fear of leaving, of moving on,
              makes it difficult to relate to Shanghai as home, even though she “feels comfortable”
              there. Shanghai can only be a temporary home, a transit space. Giovanni has a similar
              understanding. He describes himself as “feeling safe” and “a little bit like at home”
              in Shanghai,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e10245">97</xref> but when he further reflects on the
              question of home, he argues that, although he has not lived in Switzerland—the country
              of his parents and nationality—for three years now, he would, nevertheless, call it
              home. His major argument is that he is only “temporarily” in Shanghai, “like a long
              holiday” (wie lange Ferien). Again, his quote shows how Shanghai is perceived as a
              transient space, a temporary home.</p>
            <p>Giovanni’s contemplations, however, also point to the possibility of having two homes
              simultaneously, Switzerland and Shanghai, an idea many students present in interviews.
              In her writings on diaspora, Avtar Brah (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe46abae2-a772-418d-bf5e-73659abb786d">1996</xref>) answers the question of
              what “home” means with a conceptualization based on distinguishing “homing desire”
              from the “desire for homeland,” which she sees as two different simultaneous processes
              and discourses (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="IDaff1345f-e10e-4755-b36f-ef7f42d051d0">1996</xref>, 16):</p>

                <p>On the one hand, “home” is a mythic place of desire in the diasporic imagination.
                  In this sense it is a place of no return, even if it is possible to visit the
                  geographical territory that is seen as the place of “origin.” On the other hand,
                  home is also the lived experience of a locality. Its sounds and smells, its heat
                  and dust, balmy summer evenings, or the excitement of the first snowfall,
                  shivering winter evenings, somber grey skies in the middle of the day … all this,
                  as mediated by the historically specific everyday of social relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDae16be23-4208-4536-ab2c-312200154219" rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71">Brah 1996, 192</xref>).</p>

            <p>Akin to Avtar Brah’s two notions of home, eighteen-year-old Matthias explains: “I
              think, like, both are kind of home. Maybe right now I'd say rather here [in Shanghai]
              than Germany.” Later, however, Matthias identifies home less hesitatingly: “For me.
              Germany.” This seeming contradiction, having two homes, is not surprising. Students
              have the sense that they have to choose, to decide. Yet, they maintain emotional
              connections to both places.</p>
            <p>Sixteen-year-old Mia’s musings that I discussed above also illustrate Brah’s
              conceptualizations of home. Her reflections on material practices and “home-making” in
              Shanghai have shown that, while she clearly considers where she lives as “at home”
              (Zuhause), her sense of where she truly belongs, of a true “home” (Heimat), is tied to
              Germany as a country, and is symbolized by the smell of bakeries. She comments on this
              dualistic concept: </p>

            <p>The distinction she draws in German between “Zuhause” and “Heimat,” perhaps
              comparable to the English distinction between one’s house and one’s home, coincides

              However, discussing the matter further, Mia stresses that being at home is, due to her
              experiences, not only tied to a single place in her life, but is multi-local.</p>

            <p>Mia’s descriptions remind us that Brah’s definition, although at first tempting us to
              see a dualistic form of home for migrants, encompasses the “double, triple, or
              multi-placedness of ‘home’” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0290a760-d466-4a69-80b1-20a370dbabf9">Brah 1996, 194</xref>).
              Brah’s definitions of home have to be understood as applicable for multiple locations.
              This dualistic view of home, however, is widespread in migration studies. When social
              anthropologist Steven Vertovec writes about the transformation, through
              transnationalism, of “the everyday social worlds of individuals and families in both
              migrant sending and receiving contexts” (<xref rid="IDb187e322-96a5-4fc5-8fc0-953fac8e734d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID34ec8ce9-dbec-430d-8fa6-09a0487ab404">Vertovec 2004, 974</xref>), he
              summarizes various concepts describing “practices of exchange, communication and
              frequent travel” (<xref rid="IDb187e322-96a5-4fc5-8fc0-953fac8e734d" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdee485fc-7dec-4ac3-867f-e5c6fa23ff29">ibid., 974</xref>) among transmigrants
              under the umbrella term “bifocality” (<xref rid="IDb187e322-96a5-4fc5-8fc0-953fac8e734d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8e224c4f-fbeb-4744-aee5-efbe40be4844">ibid.</xref>). This “migrants’
              orientational bifocality” draws from concepts such as “bifocalism” (<xref rid="ID16bcd0c1-231a-485d-8f1a-5a946aec5d94" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1983f9c1-d4c8-46e9-998a-0babca8ec7a8">Rouse 1992</xref>), “life world” (<xref rid="ID31401880-3737-4907-902b-bca6f5469b23" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4a0f69a8-1946-4293-8835-14546d0f7efb">Smith 2001</xref>), and Guarnizo’s
              concept of a transnational habitus which is linked to a “dual frame of reference”

              “bifocality” may hold for many cases of migration, it is not applicable to all expat

              these children, the terms “Zuhause” (at home) and “Heimat” (home) do not coincide, the

              importance of the imaginary in connections between cities, the “imaginative ways in
              which places are drawn together or kept apart.” She therefore includes people who
              physically stay in one region in the process of connecting places when she argues that
              “residents are always in the process of preparing to leave for an imagined elsewhere,
              that they already know much about other cities or live [sic] an imaginary world that
              is both here and there. Within a topological imagination, making one’s way in a city
              commonly entrains a wide diversity of other places” (Robinson <xref rid="ID633077cc-2fb1-4b42-9d81-5e9fd48a5f52" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcc7b2a8f-47b6-4d0f-95ec-2552c60e46be">2010, 16</xref>). Robinson’s argument,
              which I presented in the introduction and on which I expand here, shows that ties to
              other places are vivid in our everyday lives. Moving through and living in Shanghai is
              thus constantly tied to elsewhere. However, for expatriate youths, these ties are not
              only based on imaginary scenarios (centering on future places of residence or travel
              destinations), but on memories and sensory experiences from elsewhere. Due to their
              many moves, the actors of my study are able to constantly draw from their memories of
              other places. Marco, a student at the German school and the child of a
              Brazilian-German marriage, for instance, stresses his positive relationships to a
              multiplicity of places. However, he also emphasizes the difficulties he has

            <p>In this interview, Marco openly voices his difficulties explaining his attachment to
              several places at once. His comments read as if the questions about where home is
              pressure him to make a choice. At first refraining from using the word “home,” he
              makes it clear that he feels connected to former places of residence as well as to the
              different places his family came from. He reluctantly uses the German term “Heimat” to
              refer to the city he grew up in, only to immediately state his uncertainty about this
              choice and to make it clear that he cannot state preferences or put his relationships
              with those places into words. His life is embedded in a network of different places in
              which family relations play a key role.</p>
            <p>Paul, whose case I presented in the Introduction, is also the child of a
              mixed-nationality marriage, and similarly grew up in several places, although he and
              his parents moved more often. In contrast to Marco, Paul describes his multi-local
              experiences by stating his non-attachment to places. He defines home as “wherever I am
                staying.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1151">102</xref>

            <p>Other students see their connections with multiple places as a potential status
              symbol. As Alex notes, when describing his experience to others:</p>

            <p>Alex is proud of his expat lifestyle and ties his experience to cosmopolitanism
              rather than seeing difficulties with negotiating what “home” means. One could also
              describe Alex’s classmate Kressi’s outlook as cosmopolitan. Kressi, who was fifteen
              years old when I met her and who moved from Germany to Shanghai as a toddler,
              verbalizes her idea of home by tracing her relations to relatives and friends in other
              places and by fixing home as an emotional state.</p>

            <p>Her simultaneous attachment to many places is based on people, practices, and
              emotions. These experiences of places lead to the feeling that she has a whole network
              of homes, which emerged from her family’s multiple migrations over generations. Thus
              for expatriate youths, home is always multifocal: a connection of several places,
              people, and practices. These connections can be understood as “rhizomatic.” </p>
            <p>Hindman (<xref rid="IDa34b19e5-02ff-44ac-a361-b46b6fe13502" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9ea07eb8-ed35-4c83-a3a0-f58bb046d3eb">2009b, 676</xref>) has compared the way
              “the expatriate family can spring from the soil again”—due to the tendency among
              expats to collect objects which help them articulate and recreate personal histories
              and positions in new places—to Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdeadfe1d-3f55-4076-908f-50fc30cf0734">1987</xref>) formulation of the rhizome.
              Such a rhizome, as these students’ comments illustrate, is not only a connection of
              objects, but also of places, people, and practices. Deleuze and Guattari (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDae8c9c69-3485-4001-87ed-82cb65e57c29">1987</xref>) employ the image of the
              rhizome “as subterranean stem” to encourage a new way of thinking about the
              representation and interpretation of data and the production of knowledge. They chose
              the image of the rhizome in contrast to that of “roots and radicles” which they see as
              having dominated our ways of analyzing thought until now (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID85af5a42-2062-48b7-af1d-07c3e9c6e419">ibid., 6</xref>). Unlike a tree or its
              root, “which plots a point, fixes an order” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID99d55f37-30d2-4509-b036-885e838875c1">ibid., 7</xref>) the rhizome “connects
              any point to any other point, and its traits are not necessarily linked to traits of
              the same nature; it brings into play very different regimes of signs, and even nonsign
              states” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5cd45d75-fabd-4a7e-a7e5-3568b5e56848">ibid., 21</xref>). It is in the same
              manner that the rhizomatic home includes different groups of people, practices,
              places, material goods, and senses of belonging. The rhizome, Deleuze and Guattari
              argue, underlies “principles of connection and heterogeneity” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID516af60b-ccc9-4bc5-b127-3c7253215918">ibid., 7</xref>) and may be broken, but
              is not hindered by breakage, since ruptures are inherent to it. </p>
            <p>
              <disp-quote id="dispquote32">
                <p>Every rhizome contains lines of segmentarity according to which it is stratified,
                  territorialized, organized, signified, attributed, etc., as well as lines of
                  deterritorialization down which it constantly flees. There is a rupture in the
                  rhizome whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight, but the line of
                  flight is part of the rhizome. These lines always tie back to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID0e46750d-0438-453b-b273-02ce6cb44b14" rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a">ibid., 9</xref>).</p>

            </p>
            <p>This ceaseless connection despite ruptures is also visible in the students’
              perceptions of home—moves, as ruptures, do not interrupt feelings of belonging to
              places or people that, at first glance, seem cut off. Deleuze and Guattari suggest
              that a rhizome, which has no beginning or end, cannot be traced but only mapped (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID927d39ac-78fa-4ab0-9179-1b2277d7b2cb">ibid., 12</xref>), because it is “always
              in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDebbf263c-69c3-4e94-8833-30ca2bd53b1c">ibid., 25.</xref>). This in-betweeness
              of the rhizome, of the notion of home is, for Kressi, the child of second generation
              migrants from Hong Kong and Vietnam in Germany, who was born in Germany but grew up in
              Shanghai with transnational family ties to several places, simultaneously linked to
              challenges in cultural identity:</p>

                <speaker>Kressi</speaker>
                <p><italic>The thing is, some people can simply say: “I am from Germany, but I live
                    in Shanghai.” In a sense I am, yes, I am actually German. Because my Chinese
                    isn’t that good. I also have a German passport and I grew up as a German. But
                    the problem is that I don’t look German. And I look like a Chinese or something,
                    but I just live here. But then Shanghai, nonetheless, somehow became my home
                    [Heimat], just because everything I really know is here.</italic>

              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Feeling at home is also tied to questions of identity and the right to claim a place
              as “home.” “Not looking German,” as Kressi puts it, thus makes the claim to Germany as
              her “Heimat”—according to Brah’s first definition, the place of “origin”—difficult.
              Home is tied to the politics of identity and belonging, even for affluent, privileged
              migrants. In Brah’s words:</p>
            <p>
              <disp-quote id="dispquote33">
                <p>The question of home, therefore, is intrinsically linked with the way in which
                  processes of inclusion or exclusion operate and are subjectively experienced under
                  given circumstances. It is centrally about our political and personal struggles
                  over the social regulation of “belonging” (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID933e99ed-39a3-4e26-b821-e4dd369d560d" rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71">Brah 1996, 192</xref>).</p>
              </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Kressi’s quote supports Brah’s argument that the question of home is tied to the
              “social regulation of ‘belonging.’” She explains the difficulties her non-German
              looks, and the fact that she does not speak Chinese or own a Chinese passport, cause
              her in terms of defining her home to others. Nonetheless, Kressi also explains how
              processes of emplacement—“because simply everything I really know is here”—make
              Shanghai her home. Her emphasis that living in Shanghai makes her see the place as
              home resonates well with Brah’s argument that “the double, triple, or multi-placedness
              of ‘home’ in the imaginary [sic] of people in the diaspora does not mean that such
              groups do not feel anchored in the place of settlement” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc03a7b49-22af-4a60-b094-6f2d0c457e21">Brah 1996, 194</xref>). Additionally,
              Kressi’s case shows that the idea of defining “back home” can become difficult. </p>
            <p>For some of the students, especially those who move quite often and/or have parents
              of different nationalities, Brah’s first understanding of home as “a mythic place of
              desire in the diasporic imagination” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8ca17407-5685-4574-a6f9-0b407c94bd28">Brah 1996, 192</xref>) seems to become
              less important and a source of conflict within the family. Nine-year-old Jacob, the
              son of Malay parents, describes how he has difficulty seeing Malaysia as a place he

            <p>Emily evidently does not feel “part of that place” that is supposed to be “home.”
              Returning to Brah’s concept, Malaysia can, in Emily’s case, be seen as constructed in
              the first category of home, by the parents, as a “mythic place of desire” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6d076533-37e0-4f1c-b4a0-40f8f6570a27">Brah 1996, 192</xref>). However, when
              Emily arrives, she cannot call it home, because home—for her and her brother alike—is
              linked to Brah’s second conceptualization of home as “the lived experience of a
              locality.” When she discusses this on a meta-level by stressing that her brother “has
              a different concept,” she only refers to her brother' still calling Malaysia home.
              That the siblings’ difficulties to accept Malaysia as home can lead to
              intergenerational difficulties can be seen in the following narration by Emily: </p>

            <p>The siblings’ discussion of their relationships to multiple places focuses on the
              intergenerational conflicts arising from their parents seeing Malaysia as their
              supposed “home” and the children’s refusal to accept the idea of a fixed home in a
              world of flux. For expatriate youths, ideas of home and belonging can conflict with
              those of their family or with their nationality due to how their experiences and
              emplacement processes differ. The issue is further complicated when they feel that
              others could reject their claims of belonging due, for instance, to their physical
              appearance—as Kressi mentioned in her interview.</p>
            <p>Some students, however, clearly see Shanghai as their home. Two students from the
              German School, Andrea and Antonia, both members of “the girls,” refer to Shanghai as
              their home. Andrea links this claim to her having an everyday routine there. She
              explains how she feels after returning from summer breaks in Germany:</p>

            <p>Andrea and Antonia both consider Shanghai to be their home due to their current
              residence and routine practices in the city. Antonia’s statement, “I don’t know how it
              is supposed to be different from other people,” demonstrates how she has no difficulty
              defining the city as her home. Her answer also points to an underlying annoyance
              provoked by the question. This might be because she senses that my position as a
              researcher is based on a latent assumption that the mobile lifestyle of expatriates
              brings about difficulties, an assumption which she refuses to accept. Her seeming
              annoyance may be further related to the fact that, despite growing up in Shanghai,
              being fluent in Chinese, and referring to herself as “Shanghainese,” as the child of a
              mixed-marriage and a German national, she might not be accepted as such. She
              attributes her diverse notions about feeling at home to her living in the city,
              although claiming that belonging in Shanghai often remains difficult as reciprocal
              processes of boundary drawing between “foreigners” and “locals” remain prominent. But,
              as Brah has argued, “it is quite possible to feel at home in a place and, yet, the
              experience of social exclusions may inhibit public proclamations of the place as home”
                (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0290501a-63c4-475b-b369-14b7673d1a27">1996, 193</xref>). Antonia thus
              emphasizes the idea of Shanghai as her home, while possibly also feeling the need to
              convince me during the interview because my questions often considered the high
              mobility of students. Antonia, however, has lived mostly in Shanghai, and
              distinguishes herself from other expatriate kids by repeatedly stating that she grew
              up in the metropolis.</p>

            <p>As Andrea’s and Antonia’s positions show, everyday practices and the desire for
              routine as well as (long-term) processes of emplacement contribute to students’
              claiming Shanghai as their home, and prioritizing the city over other places in their
              spatial networks. Nevertheless, while many expatriate youths may feel at home in
              Shanghai, public proclamations of the place as home remain difficult for them.</p>

          <p>As these students’ narratives and practices have shown, home is not only anchored to a
            place, but also tied to people (relatives, friends, and classmates), emotions (such as
            “feeling safe”), objects (such as furniture, photographs, and books), sensory
            impressions (such as bakery smells), and practices (like a family dinner). As Walsh
            succinctly states, “The home is experienced simultaneously as both a material and
            immaterial, lived and imagined, localized and (trans)national space of belonging” (<xref rid="ID4aa92bc8-9ac2-4ab2-901c-046cc2713454" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7e4193eb-2221-43c9-8479-2f38fe5808e1">Walsh 2006a, 123</xref>). Home is
            therefore not only a bifocal outlook on one’s “homeland” and “current home,” as former
            conceptualizations suggest (<xref rid="IDb187e322-96a5-4fc5-8fc0-953fac8e734d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1dd76ed4-30e7-4267-9009-2aec8012f7e7">see summary by Vertovec
              2004</xref>), but a multi-focal one, a network of homes. I believe that these diverse
            connections can be best understood as rhizomatic in the sense that Gilles Deleuze and
            Felix Guattari (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9d8eaf30-14a2-4380-85e7-fc5e46c5c2c2">1987</xref>) understand it. As noted
            earlier, unlike a tree or its root, “which plots a point, fixes an order” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7a6abeb1-1f95-43ad-aee6-f340344b19bb">ibid., 7</xref>), the rhizome “connects
            any point to any other point,” even if it is not usually classified as having a
            comparable nature (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe1f476b4-8ce6-4d2f-9a80-76c4d6ba4b7b">ibid., 21</xref>). It is in the same
            manner that the rhizomatic home connects different people, practices, places, material
            goods, and feelings of belonging. My analysis of the students’ rhizomatic home therefore
            identifies and maps the following aspects:</p>
          <p>First, concerning the localized and material space, the expatriate students themselves
            are actively involved in the creation of home. While they have difficulties claiming the
            communal spaces of the gated communities as home, they decorate their bedrooms and
            sometimes other domestic spaces or turn the house into home by initiating and taking
            part in family activities. In short, they transform the new site into a meaningful
            space. These home-making practices help them to not only claim the current place of
            residence as a kind of home, but also serve to identify places where they lived before
            as home. These different locations are often still closely connected. For example, I
            often witnessed that my informants’ friends who used to live in Shanghai still came to
            visit, which helped to tie the new expat location to the old one. </p>
          <p>Second, the rhizomatic home is not a mere network of multiple postings; instead, former
            and current dwelling places usually coincide with the presence of the nuclear family. It
            can therefore be said that, regardless of how “uprooted” the teenagers’ networks of
            multiple homes may seem, the underlying hegemonic idea of “home” as the nuclear family
            staying together prevails in the majority of cases. Sometimes, as in Kressi’s or Marco’s
            situation, having a large extended family can be important in the creation of the
            youth’s network of home. Melissa Butcher highlights the importance of transnational
            relationships for migrants as tools for demarcating identity and claiming a place of
            belonging:</p>
          <p>
            <disp-quote id="dispquote35">
              <p>The shared meaning embedded in relationships reaffirmed the practices of identity
                associated with that place. […] There is still an impulse to belong to a place that
                is marked by characteristics of familiarity and comfort, including elements of the
                national imagination. This is supported by the maintenance of particular
                relationships to confirm that this identity and its associated practices and values
                are shared and therefore of value (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDcda235ca-35b4-4536-af6f-821d00915a93" rid="IDbb4223f7-83ce-425c-b3a8-377a2804f547">Butcher 2009, 1369</xref>). </p>
            </disp-quote>
          </p>
          <p>Apart from the actual places where the students used to live, home is also understood
            as a feeling of connectedness and belonging. </p>
          <p>Third, regarding the imagined and immaterial aspects of the rhizomatic home, my
            discussions have shown that teenagers continuously negotiate belonging in relation to
            family members, peers, society, and many other factors, including material objects.
            While, for some students, mental images of home coincide with their parents’ ideas or
            their nationality according to their passport, for others, the issue of belonging can
            become a matter of conflict. Some struggle to negotiate conflicting feelings such as the
            desire to claim Shanghai as their home while also feeling like they are seen as “an
            exotic animal” by Shanghai’s other citizens, as Antonia describes, or handling conflicts
            with parents who consider home a fixed and definite location elsewhere, as shown in the
            discussions between the siblings Emily and Jacob. The problem of defining an emotional
            space of belonging can also lay in experiences of exclusion due to physical differences,
            as Kressi noted, when explaining her difficulty being accepted as German, due to her
            Asian phenotype. To expatriate students, the idea of home is thus also rhizomatic
            because it is “always in the middle, between things” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7c4a6f8e-b351-4ae4-bda6-4c64131865af">Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 25</xref>), and
            the concomitant feelings of belonging and positions of cultural identity often are as
            well.</p>
          <p>Finally, home can also be related to feelings of “missing.” Homelessness, as mentioned
            on all the students’ posters, and homesickness, as described by Karina who misses Prague
            and her network there, or by Mia who misses practices like the family dinners she used
            to participate in, are thus also part of the overall “homing” process. </p>
          <p>Based on the idea of the rhizome, this chapter concludes that, for many expatriate
            youths, home is always multi-sited and constantly in progress, as well as negotiated in
            relation to others. These findings can be related to the concept of TCKs (Pollock and
            Van Reken [<xref rid="ID4f741152-ae97-41a8-8de1-c2a74cab6717" ref-type="bibr" id="ID42dc6ba1-efc7-4058-b241-7e72288efadc">1999</xref>] 2009) and to Franke’s (2008)
            study mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. However, the rhizomatic home is also
            tied to concrete sites, physical belongings, and practices. While privileged migrants
            might be used to a home in flux, place nevertheless holds an important role in their
            lives. One concept investigating migrants’ mediating processes of belonging and the
            relationships they form between various spaces that fits the experiences of these
            expatriate youths better than the TCK concept is David Conradson and Deirdre McKay’s
            (2007) theory of “translocal subjectivities.” Conradson and McKay argue that mobility in
            particular “provides opportunities for new forms of subjectivity and emotion to emerge”
            (ibid., 168). In order to understand these emerging emotions and understandings of the
            self, the authors suggest adopting the concept of translocal subjectivities based on
            Appadurai’s (1996) notion of translocality. This concept aims “to describe the
            multiply-located senses of self amongst those who inhabit transnational social fields”
            (Conradson and Mckay 2007, 168). The authors understand translocal subjectivities as
            “emerging through both geographical mobility and multiple forms of ongoing emplacement”
            (ibid.). Additionally, these translocal subjectivities are often based on migrants
            relating to specific localities, rather than nation states; thus their positioning,
            relationships, and experiences become more translocal than transnational (ibid., 169).
            Finally, Conradson and McKay maintain that translocal subjectivities are shaped by “the
            emotional and affective states accompanying mobility” (ibid.). All of these aspects
            describe the subjective experiences these expatriate youths provided in their
            narratives.</p>
          <p>Relating to the last aspect, the impact of emotions on these youths’ relationships with
            their current residence can also be traced in their home-making practices, which can be
            seen as coping mechanisms. These behaviors, making and (re)imagining homes, and
            collecting belongings to produce a sense of belonging, help the youths deal with
            feelings of loneliness and enable them to let the rhizomatic home, to return to Deleuze
            and Guattari, “start up again” (<xref rid="ID00b510fa-b973-47a7-a370-a43bdefe3f6a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7fb20c91-1dc3-4e55-9441-7e378f841a71">Deleuze and Guattari 1987,
              9</xref>). </p>
          <p>When it comes to coping with feeling uprooted, and the often conflicting feelings about
            home that this chapter discusses, children and youths tend to draw from the resources
            provided by their new school. It is in these schools that they receive further support,
            especially from their peers, to deal with such challenges. The following chapter
            explores the spaces of international schools and their role in the process of creating a
            community for students and their families. </p>

        <p>With remarks similar to those of these three teenage boys, all of the students I
          interviewed confirmed the importance school played in offering them the opportunity to
          make friends and fight loneliness, while also offering a sense of continuity. School
          provides a space to establish a new social circle outside the family. Eleven-year-old
          Allen explains the role of the school in the following way:</p>
        <p>
          <speech id="speech190">
            <speaker>Allen</speaker>
            <p><italic>Depending upon what your everyday life is like, for instance, if you live
                near lots of Chinese people and you go to a private Chinese school, it makes a big
                impact. And then if you go to an international school, it makes the moving a lot
                easier. Because everyone there, they’re in the same, same space as everyone else
                around them, from moving from their home country to somewhere other than their home
                country. And also because of the communication, because it is easier to communicate
                than with a lot of Chinese people. </italic>
            </p>
          </speech>
        </p>
        <p>What is this experience that Allen describes as everyone being in “the same space?” What
          constitutes this space that schools provide, where, according to Allen, communication is
          easier and everyone feels unified by a common experience? This chapter attempts to answer
          these questions by examining the sites, values, practices, and students’ experiences
          within international schools in Shanghai.</p>
        <p>The chapter begins with a description of the international schools in Shanghai and their
          common characteristics. Next, by describing a short movie that was produced by two
          students at a German school, I provide a detailed example of the efforts schools make to
          create a sense of community (at which they are the center). In the third section, I argue
          that these different school “communities” all see themselves as part of a larger unifying
          expatriate collective, where everyone is in the “same space.” I show how this
          “expatriateness” is learned, maintained, and performed along three aspects that were
          particularly prominent during my fieldwork: the common comfort lying in the norm of having
          a maid and a driver, the social concern cultivated through practices of charity, and the
          distinctions maintained through cosmopolitan cultural capital. Finally, I investigate the
          youths’ own experiences of attending an international school in Shanghai by contending
          with two topics which dominate their narratives: privilege and pressure.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>3.1 Shanghai’s landscape of international schools</title>
          <p>The private international schools in Shanghai are places of central importance for
            expatriate youths. Upon analyzing these schools, not in terms of their academic
            curricula or achievements, but as particular places, they can be characterized by the
            five following attributes: their exclusion of Chinese students, the exclusion of foreign
            students without the financial means to meet high tuition fees, their geographical
            locations in the suburbs, their strict regulations and well-guarded gates, and their
            roles as expatriate community centers. I will expand on these points, and the last two
            aspects in particular, to illustrate the role of the school in (teenage) expatria.</p>
          <p>The first main characteristic of the international schools in Shanghai is that students
            with Chinese passports are excluded. International schools form a distinct sub-sector.
            Within this sector, schools can be divided into foreign-run schools and divisions of
            local schools. Both are targeted solely at foreign passport holders. Shanghai’s numerous
            international schools differ in their curricula, teaching language, type of diploma
            offered, student body nationalities admitted, and form of organization. Yamato and Bray
              (<xref rid="IDc2bfc71e-b880-4b0d-811f-2d7fb2f9fac7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd92f28e4-e13c-424f-9ebd-ccbdef7ea1cd">2006, 79</xref>) found that “the
            English-medium schools were more international because they used a language that has
            wide portability.” This point is in keeping with my findings: at the French and
            German-medium schools, students represented considerably fewer nationalities than at
            their English counterparts. While Chinese government regulations prohibit local children
            of Chinese nationality from enrolling at any of these international schools (<xref rid="IDc2bfc71e-b880-4b0d-811f-2d7fb2f9fac7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa1d16fcc-e031-47d0-9362-29ac751f2162">Yamato and Bray 2006, 64</xref>), the
            Shanghai municipal authorities can grant exceptions to special cases. During my
            research, however, I only met one student who had been granted this permission.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1608">113</xref> The resulting absence of locals therefore seems to be
            a major difference between the international schools in Shanghai and those elsewhere
              (<xref rid="IDb055cc5e-b457-4214-9e33-3ff3be211480" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbd51e1fc-b519-4f0c-96dc-69e886adb3d0">see Dobeneck’s (2010, 115–118</xref>)
            descriptions of German-medium schools in Sao Paulo, for example). </p>
          <p>International schools in Shanghai all charge tuition fees. This is also the case for
            schools that are run by non-profit agencies. Their tuition fees for the 2010–2011 school
            year ranged from approximately RMB 88,500 to 240,000 (€9,735 to €26,400) per year at the
            high school level. In many cases, tuition costs are covered by the expatriate packages
            provided by the parents’ employers. Some schools offer different fees for families
            paying through private means. However, the second main characteristic of the
            international schools in Shanghai is that they exclude students whose parents cannot
            afford the tuition fees.</p>
          <p>Yamato and Bray found that the schools they studied, and the English-medium schools
              (<xref rid="IDc2bfc71e-b880-4b0d-811f-2d7fb2f9fac7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb8b30ad6-d18e-42e9-8125-c14824b4ebe6">2006, 59</xref>;79) in particular, were in
            competition with each other. In consequence, they try to find their own niches,
            sometimes also through location: “Schools can increase their market shares by securing
            premises in the suburbs in which their potential clients are concentrated” (ibid. <xref rid="IDc2bfc71e-b880-4b0d-811f-2d7fb2f9fac7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDcd01733c-4c37-4ff4-a5d8-786d5ef75a1f">2006, 59</xref>). The choice of school and
            the choice of housing area are therefore connected. Thus a third main characteristic of
            the international schools is their location on the outskirts of the city, in the
            vicinity of the spacious gated communities described in the previous chapter. </p>
          <p>Finally, international schools are highly regulated and sealed-off spaces. It is not
            surprising that human geographers of youth stress that the space of the school is
            under-researched (<xref rid="ID951fc9af-c593-41c8-9b3a-ccf6fee76d83" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7983c401-1a2d-46ad-ad52-bef2f0f929c7">Valentine 2003, 42</xref>). Studies
            involving minors and closed institutions are complicated by difficulties of access. Many
            of my own email inquiries remained unanswered, even though I included letters of
            references, research outlines, my résumé, and other information. Whenever I had
            opportunities to meet principals in person, they were usually in favor of my research
            project, although the disruption of school activities and regular classes was a concern.
            Some schools, like a British international school located in Pudong, supported the
            project by contacting students and parents and letting me conduct interviews with them
            on the school’s premises. A German school’s staff was even so kind as to let me sit in
            on certain classes. A Singaporean school principal and teacher were also supportive and
            found a solution that included me teaching a Theory of Knowledge class and allowed me to
            conduct interviews. An American middle school’s counselor allowed me to see the school
            facilities and meet teachers at a career development day for staff. Interviews with
            students, however, were denied as the school objected to the perceived organizational
            effort that would be required. The only other personal contact I had was with the
            principals of another American international school. Here, although one language teacher
            and six of her students were eager to participate, the school management objected. We
            had to cancel the interviews despite students’, parents’, and teachers’ agreements.
            However, I learned much about the same school by visiting one elementary class in
            another capacity. Although another British school never replied to my inquiries, I had
            the opportunity to see their campus during a volunteer activity. For the students from a
            French school and an American Christian school, the path was different, as their friends
            whom I had interviewed earlier introduced me to them. I conducted these interviews
            outside of school and thus without any discussions with the schools’ management. As the
            German and French schools I visited are on the same campus, I had the opportunity to
            acquaint myself with the French school’s setting. I did not have the opportunity to see
            the campus of the American Christian school, though. I also contacted numerous other
            schools, from which I never received an answer or which I simply could not include for
            consideration, due to constraints in time and resources.</p>
          <p>All of the schools are located on the outskirts of the city and have fenced-off
            campuses with regulated access to their spaces. At every school I visited, I had to get
            a visitor’s pass before being allowed to enter, which I then had to wear around my neck
            for the day. Policies varied from providing your name, phone number, and the name of the
            person to be visited, to requiring identity checks and body temperature controls for
            health reasons. Some of the schools, such as an American school I visited in Pudong,
            even have a second wall around them because they are located within gated communities.
            The following image, which depicts this gated community, is included to give an
            impression of international schools’ surroundings <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">
              (Figure 14).</xref> However, as the security guards in front of the school prohibited
            me from taking photos of the school itself, and in order to keep institutions anonymous,
            I cannot show specific buildings.</p>
          <p>These experiences of efforts to regulate access are, of course, less obvious to
            students than they are to a researcher or outsider. However, schools with their dress
            codes (some schools require uniforms), schedules, and scheduled breaks are
            well-regulated spaces for the students as well. Students from the German and French
            campus have to enter and exit the school premises through doors equipped with card
            readers. Only the upper-grade students can exit these during the school day. However,
            sometimes students sneak around these, risking the punishment of having to work in the
            cafeteria.</p>

          <p>The fifth aspect of international schools in Shanghai is their role as community hubs.
            Students’ lives obviously revolve around their schools as places of education,
            friendship, and after-school activities such as sports or artistic hobbies. However, in
            many cases, the international schools in Shanghai seem to be not only central to the
            children, to for the adult expatriate community as well. It is not surprising that a
            popular parental guidebook for expatriates strongly advises parents to become active at
            the school:</p>
          <p>
            <disp-quote id="dispquote39">
              <p>Finally, I want to stress again the importance of getting involved with your
                child’s new school in an overseas setting. Not only will your child find this a
                positive sign of your interest in them, but your involvement in the school community
                is a wonderful way to help create a new “extended family” for celebrating holidays
                far from home, traveling within the country, or just getting together with other
                parents to compare notes on the weekend. If you stayed away from parents’
                organizations before you moved abroad (and let other parents handle all the
                volunteer work that enhanced your child’s life), now’s your chance to repay that
                debt (Pascoe 2006, 142).</p>

          <p>Many schools offer social activities where parents can meet, or cultural activities
            that everyone (or at least everyone associated with the school) can participate in. Some
            schools are more ethnically focused in their activities and networks than others, but
            all have parents’ organizations and provide cultural activities, such as plays, dances,
            bazaars, sporting events, or orientations. Schools also sell branded items such as
            yearbooks, T-shirts, or school bags. Fiona Moore (<xref rid="IDfb989e33-e9c8-4b63-8083-bf99eb7b5a99" ref-type="bibr" id="ID626e9f3b-59a9-4263-82e0-4a6ed074c5dd">2008</xref>), who examined the German
            school in London (Deutsche Schule London, abbreviated here as “DSL”) from an adult
            perspective, found that it serves a central role for the German community. “One of the
            DSL’s explicit functions is a site for the adjustment and development of networks of the
            spouses of expatriates, with a particular focus on female spouses” (<xref rid="IDfb989e33-e9c8-4b63-8083-bf99eb7b5a99" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdc1b0d4d-e543-4760-b0b3-b342e88154d5">Moore 2008, 94</xref>). She furthermore
            argues that this important connection in the network for German expatriates in London
            “not only educates the children, but also provides a forum for the expression of
            Germanness” (<xref rid="IDfb989e33-e9c8-4b63-8083-bf99eb7b5a99" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc77584c4-20e2-462c-8840-ca3bdeac2e91">Moore 2008, 91</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1654">115</xref> The international schools in Shanghai obviously create similar

          <p>While schools seem attractive when presented as such “safe havens,” their exclusionary
            practices also have to be kept in mind—an aspect that this metaphor problematically
            conceals. As major nodes in the expatriate networks, schools have a strong influence on
            the expatriate way of life. The British school I visited, for example, provides a
            “Shanghai resident map” that, in addition to the school campuses, includes the location
            of compounds, foreign-run medical centers, churches, shopping locations, spas, cinemas,
            and restaurants that have become favorites among expats. The German school provides
            lists of popular residential compounds online. While some school communities, such as
            the German school, are strongly tied to national communities, they all, however, see
            themselves as part of the larger expatriate community. The expatriate experience is a
            unifying framework based on the construction of a shared concept of expatriate identity
            that transcends the national, cultural and ethnic differences among the various
            expatriate communities in Shanghai. In the following section, I provide a key example of
            the schools’ pivotal and well-guarded role at the core of the larger expatriate network
            in Shanghai, by zooming in on the German school, the site of the largest portion of my
            research.</p>

          <title>3.2. Image and community</title>
          <p>The international schools actively support processes of national as well as
            international expatriate community building through various means and see themselves as
            major centers in Shanghai’s expatriate communities. One project, produced by two
            students at the German school, exemplifies the efforts such schools make to encourage
            the idea that communities revolve around them. The project, a short video produced by
            the student Kressi and one of her friends, was made to be shown at an awards ceremony in
              Berlin.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1671">116</xref> The roughly five minute video opens with
            an image of the school’s logo and motto, followed by a black screen, and the
            announcement “präsentiert” (presents). The next sequence shows impressions filmed out of
            a moving car. The color of the vehicle and the driver’s taxi license reveal what locals
            would recognize as a typical Shanghai taxi. A title then fades in to announce what the
            clip presents, “My Time is Now: Das Zeitprojekt” (The Time Project), a reference to an
            art project for which the school won a prize, as is further introduced in the next
            caption: “Kinder zum-Olymp!—Sonderpreis-Gewinner 2011” (Children to Olympus—Award Winner
            2011). These images and texts are accompanied by melodic whistling, the beginning of the
            song “Home,” by Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. When the lyrics start, “Alabama,
            Arkansas, I do love my ma and pa,” the taxi ride changes to blurry images zooming in on
            Shanghai’s Bund and a Chinese flag, while a caption in white letters introduces
            “Shanghai, China, 上海.” Despite being targeted at a German audience, the Chinese
            characters are included in the caption, presumably to emphasize the school’s special or
            even “exotic” location. The words then make room for images. The flag and buildings
            become increasingly clearer. The viewer realizes that the camera is zooming in on the
            Bund with its iconic buildings. While the Bund is still a blurred image, we read “21
            Millionen Einwohner” (21 million inhabitants), which then fades and reveals the full,
            now-focused image of the new Pudong side of the Bund. A photo of overpasses and traffic
            signs, with high-rise buildings in the background, follows. Inserted text which appears
            and fades out again simply reads: “modern” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15"> (Figure
              15).</xref></p>
          <p>The subsequent shot shows a temple yard with people burning incense; the caption now
            reads “traditionell zugleich” (traditional at the same time). Images of the old lane
            houses in Taikang Road are next, blending into a picture of metro signs and then again
            of high-rise buildings with the caption: “dynamische Wirtschaftsmetropole” (dynamic
            commercial metropolis). The white letters fade, the skyscrapers become sharp and then
            quickly dissolve into numerous squares that turn around to reveal an image of the school
            building. While the school building appears, blurs, and comes into focus again, letters
            boldly announce: “Zuhause” (Home)—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16"> (Figure
            16a).</xref></p>
          <p>This image is followed by recordings of students entering and leaving school, played in
            fast-forward, with a new text line appearing, continuing the message from the last
            image: “Für 1230 Schüler an zwei Schulstandorten” (For 1230 students on two campuses).
            We then, still in fast mode, enter the school premises, while the song continues: “Home,
            home, home, is wherever I’m with you.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16"> (Figure
              16b).</xref></p>
          <p>Inside the school, we can observe, for a few quick moments in fast-forward mode, the
            daily business of students running around and parents picking up their children. Then a
            series of photographs follows, introducing the viewer to numerous school projects and
            events, such as music workshops, concerts, art projects (I will further explore one such
            project by the student Andrea in Part IV, Chapter 1), yearbook awards, theater, and the
            graduation ceremony <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16"> (Figure 16c).</xref></p>
          <p>Four of the almost five minutes of the video present numerous activities, but do not
            offer any insights into the daily routines or regular classroom interactions that shape
            everyday life at school. Here, the school is presented as an active, arts-oriented,
            lively community, not only depicting numerous projects and students, but also different
            audiences at the events. At the end, the video clip takes us back to the Bund, this time
            at night. The city of Shanghai, depicted in the beginning and at the end, thus frames
            the images of the school, staging the campus—which could be anywhere—as international.
            These last shots are then headed with captions that bid the viewer “Good bye!” in
            Chinese and “Greetings from Shanghai” in German, to then finally return to the school’s
            logo and motto from the very beginning<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16"> (Figure
              16d).</xref>
          </p>
          <p>In the video, the institution is staged as a lively community framed by recognizable,
            even clichéd images of Shanghai. When talking with student Kressi about the production
            of the video, it becomes clear that it was filmed with the intention of representing the
            school’s art class on the one hand, and the school as a whole on the other.</p>

          <p>Kressi and her friend were happy to shoot the movie on behalf of the school because she
            enjoys being creative, but also because it enabled her and her friend to get the chance
            to spend a weekend in Berlin. The movie therefore is not only a creative project by two
            teenage girls, but also a public relations product that was requested by the school,
            which in turn funded their trip to Europe. However, while the school decided which
            events and art and music projects were to be depicted, it was the two girls who chose to
            accompany the images with the song. When I asked her about the choice of music, Kressi
            explained:</p>

                  Shanghai is only like it is because of the people, or because of the people we
                  know. And that’s why the song just fit really well. Well, we also liked the beat
                  and we could cut the images along with it nicely.</italic>

            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>For Kressi, school life is tied to her friends, and these friendships and connections
            create a feeling (in the words of the song) of home. The people, everyday practices, and
            ideals presented in the video produce, in a reciprocal process, the image of the school
            as being central to the community.</p>
          <p>In this process, the school’s material culture also plays a role. Gerd Baumann and
            Thijl Sunier (<xref rid="ID3a356828-fa37-4543-8da9-6a4ce436694e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID05e63cab-31a4-40cd-b3f2-1e63d6e4f804">2002, 34–36</xref>), in their detailed
            description and comparison of four different comprehensive schools in Paris, London,
            Berlin, and Rotterdam, see different national ideas of citizenship reflected in the ways
            the school premises are decorated and managed; the school gates in particular are seen
            as symbolic of the attitudes and practices each nation espouses, along with that
            nation’s ideas of how to manage ethnic diversity and political engagement. David
            MacDougall’s (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa0d4b633-cdc6-4fba-bafe-ff02a08727e8">2006</xref>) concept of social aesthetics,
            which I presented in the Introduction and now expand upon, emphasizes how this specific
            material culture—a school’s premises, the equipment, and the regulations revolving
            around it—affects the students engaging with that environment on a daily basis. With the
            term “social aesthetics,” he describes “the creation of an aesthetic space or sensory
            structure” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0ec788c9-5f8e-44f2-9792-92f862480b57">2006, 105</xref>). Aesthetics here do not
            mean notions of beauty or art, but a “wider range of culturally patterned sensory
            experience” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf6796092-d04d-45af-9d6e-32de3ad49d05">ibid., 98</xref>). MacDougall understands
            the social aesthetic field as a coalescence of different elements such as “objects and
            actions.” Analyzing the social aesthetic field therefore means focusing on a specific
            community and its landscape—its material environment as well as the day to day practices
            taking place in that environment. MacDougall suggests, based on his work on the
            prestigious Doon School in India, that societies “may find in the sharing of a strong
            aesthetic experience a unifying principle” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4b984c7a-99d4-4b08-b4d7-47c6c658e7e6">ibid., 99</xref>). The social aesthetics
            in the spaces of the German international schools therefore can also be seen as serving
            to create the students’ sense of belonging. MacDougall suggests paying attention to
            specific objects in relation to daily practices: “The social aesthetic field is never
            mutual or random: its patterning creates forces and polarities with strong emotional
            effects. Ordinary objects with which one comes in daily contact take on a particular
            aura, and this aura is augmented by repetition and multiplication” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID939355f5-7ed9-4e2e-98df-57b811c6586f">MacDougall 2006, 111</xref>).</p>
          <p>While this aura of repetition is not present in the video described here, which focuses
            primarily on community events, it is omnipresent in the everyday school experience of
            expat youths. This aura of repetition is, for instance, evoked by the routine of passing
            through the school gates with student IDs in the morning, seeking out one’s place in the
            rarely changing seating arrangement in the classrooms, or waiting for the teachers.
            Specific structures further shape the social aesthetics, whether they be the precisely
            measured units of lessons and breaks, the rules of where and when to eat, the decision
            about who is allowed to take the elevator and who must take the stairs—a major issue at
            the Singaporean school I visited—or the regulations about leaving the premises. These
            routines provide the students with a sense of community. It is therefore not surprising
            that, only after comprehending all these rules—which were somehow self-evident to the
            students—I began to feel comfortable at the school myself (see my descriptions of a day
            at the German school in Part I, Chapter 2). </p>
          <p>The school events (such as those presented in the students’ PR film) help the school
            present itself as a true community by including parents and other (German) adults. I
            myself, for instance, gained access to the German school through such an event. Fiona
            Moore, in her article on the German school in London, shows that the network revolving
            around the school actively aims for the creation of a new generation of young German
            transnational actors, for example through providing students with internships at
            prestigious institutions (<xref rid="IDfb989e33-e9c8-4b63-8083-bf99eb7b5a99" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc74b3fa2-cac1-441d-9b9d-22c98b02a7db">Moore 2008, 97</xref>). A
            sensitive look at the role of Shanghai’s international schools reveals that they not
            only play a key role in creating a home or community for the students, but also promote
            general identification with other international expatriates. In other words, schools
            become powerful institutions for both educating and fostering a national or school
            community and shaping forms of belonging by unifying expatriates.</p>

          <title>3.3. Learning and living “expatriateness”</title>
          <p>The sense of an expatriate community is produced through various means under the strong
            influence of international schools. The creation of and belonging to expatria can be
            seen as diasporic forms of community creation and simultaneously understood as a class
            or habitus consciousness, rendered visible through everyday (material) practices,
            identity performances, and the accumulation of cultural capital. Before drawing on three
            cases from my fieldwork to support these arguments, I will briefly discuss the role of
            education in forming a community, class, or habitus and explain my choice of the term
            “expatriateness.”</p>
          <p>Johanna Waters, drawing on Butler (2003), argues that “education is inextricably linked
            to the existence and recreation of a middle-class habitus that includes a closely
            guarded sub-culture of ‘community’” (Waters 2007, 480). In her article, “‘Roundabout
            Routes and Sanctuary Schools:’ The Role of Situated Educational Practices and Habitus in
            the Creation of Transnational Professionals,” Waters (2007) examines the formation of
            transnational professionals in Hong Kong. Since children’s education has been cited as a
            major reason for internationally-educated locals to leave Hong Kong, her study focuses
            particularly on the role of international education and the complex familial strategies
            centered on it. Her case studies in Hong Kong and Vancouver suggest “the active creation
            of group boundaries and the cultivation and inculcation of an exclusive identity through
            segregation and similar education and migration experiences” (Waters 2007, 492). Waters’
            description of the creation of group boundaries provides a very different reading of the
            phenomenon that Pollock and Van Reken ([<xref rid="ID4f741152-ae97-41a8-8de1-c2a74cab6717" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb449c7a7-a1d8-40b9-afd8-bf31523844f2">1999</xref>] 2009) present in their
            literature on TCKs, which sees the formation of these boundaries as a positive
            experience of healing and belonging for mobile youths. Education and habitus among the
            internationally-educated locals Waters studied in Hong Kong therefore create a group
            that is both spatially and socially distinct. While international schools and overseas
            schooling “is clearly the preserve of the wealthy and privileged,” Waters also argues
            that “it is often used as a means of avoiding failure in the local (and far more
            ‘challenging’ and competitive) system.” Waters concludes that education “plays a pivotal
            role in the creation of an exclusive and elite group identity” and that this distinctive
            group identity is “rewarded in the labour market” (Waters 2007, 494). German sociologist
            Michael Hartmann’s research on social origin and educational trajectories among the
            business elite in Germany and France (Hartmann 2000) similarly found that a
            class-specific habitus is decisive—in a direct sense in Germany and, indirectly, through
            attending elite universities in France—for an individual’s career. He argues that “it is
            a class-specific habitus that ensures the high stability of social recruitment” and that
            it “can forge a sufficient internal bond even without such an institutionalization of

            community of transnational professionals is evident in my research in Shanghai as well.
            I argue that, just like the group of transnational professionals Waters (<xref rid="ID63de82ed-b384-4b14-b755-217539cfdc43" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4211ad27-7681-4bda-aa89-989b3e945356">2007</xref>) studies in Hong Kong, the
            international education of expatriate offspring plays a major role in forging bonds and
            creating an exclusive group identity. The opportunity to attend an international school
            is an argument for the move, as well as the pride and status many families gain from the
            experience. A German mother of three children (ages seven to fourteen) whom I
            interviewed during my earlier fieldwork in 2007, for instance, explained how the option
            for international schooling influenced her decision to move to Malaysia and later
            Shanghai:</p>

                China, where “they are travelling to.” Their new lifestyle includes the service of
                maids and drivers, private schooling, regular international travel, and vacations.

          <p>The term “elite,” nevertheless, proves difficult as well. I am hesitant to apply it to

            George Marcus (<xref rid="IDdf79e467-2ced-4f3b-b209-8e0d39ca36bd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID33a331d4-4b4f-43bc-a8e2-2904b91b14a5">1983a, 9</xref>) has pointed out.
            Furthermore, the term “elite” is unsuitable for my research perspective due to its
            associated research tradition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1791">122</xref> My focus on
            expatriate youths’ voices, which allows for the in-depth analysis of age-specific and
            subjective experiences of transnational migration, cannot simultaneously center on the
            “nature of the larger system in which it is meaningful to label them as elites” (<xref rid="IDdf79e467-2ced-4f3b-b209-8e0d39ca36bd" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbb6b6b28-d283-44f4-af9a-f0ce441dbefe">Marcus 1983a, 13</xref>). Therefore, I
            find the term “elite” misleading for my analysis of the processes of community building,
            status, habitus, and class in the realm of the students’ schools and their environment.
            These entangled negotiations of a community/habitus/class shall therefore, instead, be
            described as practicing “expatriateness.” </p>
          <p>The expatriate community in Shanghai is diverse in many ways and maintains inner
            divisions of class, ethnicity, and nationality. It consists of its many specific groups
            revolving around certain clubs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1811">123</xref>—which are often
            tied to nationality—institutions, companies, neighborhoods, and other organizations.
            Here, the international schools play a lead role. People connected to the German School,
            for instance, despite their differences, consider themselves a group, as one small
            community in expatria. Most youths and their families would, at the same time, also see
            a larger expatriate network as existing in Shanghai and, for example, by labeling
            various places they frequent as “expatriate,” consider themselves part of Shanghai’s
            overall expatriate community.</p>
          <p>The making of this expatriate community can be viewed in the same way that
            anthropologist Cris Shore (<xref rid="IDb5f61c48-005f-4a63-aeae-eb5938e97842" ref-type="bibr" id="ID85e3b71e-99e5-43c3-b7a1-35b0495d7858">2002</xref>) discusses the
            making of elites, drawing on Bourdieu’s (<xref rid="IDc2674665-7609-469c-9b32-1a0ab3cfd50d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID87c2799e-71c9-4003-a11a-12025683ff57">1984</xref>) notion of distinction: “in
            order to constitute itself as an elite in the first place an elite group must develop
            its own particularistic set of interests, norms and practices to differentiate itself
            from the masses. It must achieve ‘distinction’” (Shore <xref rid="IDb5f61c48-005f-4a63-aeae-eb5938e97842" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbf419e17-4931-4adb-bde9-9ad990c82ed2">2002</xref>, 2–3).</p>
          <p>Regarding the distinction of elite groups, Shore sees the question of “how they do
            this” and the examination of the “cultural resources they mobilise and the way they
            cultivate functions” as important issues for anthropology (<xref rid="IDb5f61c48-005f-4a63-aeae-eb5938e97842" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3e9dc10d-e0c0-4c21-9b01-646c9e56b1b9">ibid., 3</xref>). In order to understand
            how expatriate youths learn “expatriateness,” I investigated spatial practices and other
            forms of everyday activities that serve to create a distinct collective expatriate
            identity. Exclusion and inclusion along ethnic lines also play a major role, as
            exemplified by the experience German student Don, who is of Chinese descent, shared (see
            Part III, Chapter 1) regarding his treatment by entrance guards at his friends’
            compounds. Undeniably, whiteness is one of the strongest markers for “expatriateness”
            (see also Part IV, Chapter 4).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1825">124</xref> However, there are
            many subtle practices of creating and maintaining “expatriateness,” be it through
            sharing educational values or through creating demarcations from not only those “back
            home” but also from the local Shanghainese. I will use three examples that were
            particularly relevant during my fieldwork to tease out how “expatriateness” is
            performed, maintained, and taught among expatriate youths: first, the convenience
            associated with the norm of having a maid and a driver, second, the social concern
            cultivated through practices of charity and social outreach work, and third, the
            distinctions maintained through their cosmopolitan cultural capital.</p>

          <p>Antonia, who grew up in Shanghai, recognizes the privileged ways of life Shanghai
            offers expatriate youths on one hand but, on the other hand, does not associate having
            staff at home with privilege or luxury; she sees these circumstances as quotidian, as an
            ordinary part of life. Her double perspective, maybe triggered by my presence as a
            researcher, reminds me of Conradson and Latham’s call to consider aspects of the
            ordinary underlying transnational mobility:</p>
          <p>
            <disp-quote id="dispquote42">
              <p>Viewed from this quotidian angle, even the most hyper-mobile transnational elites

                and taught a set of values. They have friends to keep up with and relatives to
                honour. While such lives may be stressful and involve significant levels of
                dislocation, for those in the midst of these patterns of activity, this effort is
                arguably simply part of the taken-for-granted texture of daily existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="IDaecef222-31e6-4695-bfae-b0dff29b5a53" rid="IDca72b116-f6ef-4d47-b21f-68e999a1e313">Conradson and Latham 2005,

            <p>The previous section shows that a certain amount of material wealth and displays of
              class status contribute to the meaning of “expatriateness,” a meaning that will
              dissolve if certain activities are not repeatedly performed and valued.
              “Expatriateness” is, therefore, also a performance (<xref rid="IDbd77fdf2-b150-4238-8845-8ad7e6877ac0" ref-type="bibr" id="IDad136866-6c59-44af-b5b6-825ea1523e43">Goffman 1963</xref>) and one practice
              contributing to it is charity work. In September 2010, very early in my fieldwork, I
              consulted different websites providing help for expatriates living in Shanghai. I
              registered for an event called Interkom CityServe that was directed at teenagers.
              Interkom is a youth program at the Community Center Shanghai that offers various
              courses and activities for the expatriate community. At this event, different outreach
              organizations were presenting their work at the community center in the Jingqiao
              district and teenagers had the opportunity to contact these organizations in person
              and get involved in social outreach work in Shanghai. While initially impressed by the
              high turnout, I later learned, in conversations with students, that community work is
              part of the mandatory curriculum if you pursue an IB (International Baccalaureate).
              Social outreach work is thus a requirement for all students at many international
              schools.</p>

                  organization Rivers of Hearts, in October 2010. The organization had been
                  collecting clothing donations over the last several months. During the six hours I
                  spent sorting clothes to go to rural areas in China I was able to glimpse yet
                  another part of expatriate life. Working at a table with three teenage girls from
                  Taiwan, I learned through short conversations in-between the shouts of “Men
                  winter? Women summer! Children winter!” and “What do we do with towels? Shoes?
                  Hats?” that many of the students who attended the event had done so together for
                  school, and were awarded credit points afterward. The students from the school
                  where the three girls I worked alongside had come from were accompanied and
                  supervised by a social worker from their school. While constantly running to bring
                  clothes to the packing station or to get new piles of unsorted donations, I
                  counted approximately 200 people attending the event, mostly teenagers, although
                  young children from scout troops, as well as a group of American college students
                  and a few older adults, mostly teachers, helped out as well. The clothes had all
                  been donated by expatriates in Shanghai and the event was handled entirely by
                  expats. At the beginning, everyone was in high spirits and convinced of the
                  event’s good cause. Only toward the end, when the truck was packed and cleaning
                  and tying shoes together were the last tasks to remain, did students start to
                  leave, tired from their work <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17"> (Figure

            <p>Although social outreach work was not mandatory at the German school that I focused
              on, the role of charity had also become an integral part of their community. When a
              devastating earthquake hit Japan in the spring of 2011, for instance, the older
              students organized a bake sale to collect money <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">
                (Figure 18).</xref></p>
            <p>While observing the older students selling and the younger students buying the
              home-made cake—mostly baked by mothers—during breaks at school, I learned that the
              school principal himself had encouraged students to organize such an event. Such
              involvement on the highest administrator’s part underlines the central role of the
              school in communicating the importance of and fostering engagement with social
              outreach work. Cultivating concern for the social and ecological problems of today’s
              world is, therefore, not only part of schools’ lesson plans; this concern is also
              expressed through charity work that simultaneously reaffirms collective expatriate
              identities as compassionate donors and managers of global problems. It is this
              claiming of a global outlook that particularly unites and fosters the expatriate
              community.</p>

            <p>When visiting international schools, I could not help noticing their preference for
              decorating school buildings with various national flags. Indeed, it was often these
              flags that enabled me recognize the school building at first sight <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19"> (Figure 19).</xref></p>
            <p>As the first and fourth image above show, the schools display flags, often
              representing all the nationalities of their enrolled students, not only outside, but
              also inside to decorate corridors. These banners are an element of the “social
              aesthetics” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8b127369-f9c1-48b7-b13a-2210ded91ea0">MacDougall 2006</xref>) of all
              international schools. The pride taken in the internationality of a school community,
              rendered visible for every student and visitor by these flags, is also mirrored in the
              students’ narratives of international school life. When, during an interview in June
              2012 (just after graduation), Kressi commented, as I had heard so often, on the
              internationality and diversity of her classmates, I suggested, in an attempt to be a
              bit provocative, that the German school might not even be considered very
              international, as most of the students who attended it were German. Kressi, however,
              insisted that it was, explaining:</p>

            <p>Kressi’s description of the different “perspectives,” “stories,” and “experiences”
              students share due to the “cultures in which the people have lived,” illustrates how
              she sees classmates as not simply being tied to one culture, but as individuals whose
              practices and cultural identities are shaped by a plurality that relates to the ideas
              of transculturation and the gaining of transcultural perspectives that I discussed in
              the Introduction. In the realm of school and education, however, I think students’
              experiences of processes of transculturation, of experiencing different places as
              crucial for “what defines them,” can also be conceptualized as what German
              ethnographer Jana Binder defines as “globality” (<xref rid="ID5784a023-edca-4603-a962-615d4f39eb34" ref-type="bibr" id="ID658a8b29-720a-41df-9ab6-4f44aeec3fe1">Binder 2005</xref>). Binder interprets
              and summarizes backpackers’ travel experiences in Asia and convincingly argues that
              long-term travelers develop their narratives of the trip along with their competence
              dealing with the challenges of a globalizing world. She calls these experiences and
              their representations—such as being in a certain place, experiencing oneself in a
              different environment, meeting people of other nationalities, or changing one’s
              lifestyle—“globality.” She further argues that this “globality” should be understood
              as a cultural resource in the Bourdieusian sense, as capital. Using the example of
              young backpackers, Binder shows how knowledge of contemporary processes of change and
              their associated discourses are turned into cultural capital and can be used
              advantageously (<xref rid="ID5784a023-edca-4603-a962-615d4f39eb34" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3e7c73c4-abd6-430b-b9cc-6116b7dd1d67">ibid., 215</xref>). Applying this
              understanding of “globality” to the moving practices of expatriate teenagers and their
              career prospects brings similar views to the fore. Accumulating experiences of
              different places is seen, by expatriate teenagers and their parents, as a symbol of
              status and competence. Luke Desforges (<xref rid="ID55d5cf39-ffe2-4849-9c9d-e5bf2c1ecc5a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc0140b62-17d5-456a-9919-239fb64f245e">1998</xref>), who explores the ways in
              which British middle-class youths negotiate and build their identities through travel,
              claims (not unlike Binder) that young people convert the cultural capital they gather
              from their independent travels into economic capital in the workplace upon their
              return. Drawing on Desforges’s study, Gill Valentine argues that, through their
              travel, youths “participate in a process of othering and constructing ﬁrst world
              representations of the third world, while simultaneously earning themselves a
              privileged position in the West” (<xref rid="ID951fc9af-c593-41c8-9b3a-ccf6fee76d83" ref-type="bibr" id="ID135a9bda-34f0-468e-8da5-495ab22c7262">Valentine 2003,
                45</xref>). As student Kressi argues, the exchange of the experiences of various
              places, cultural practices, and values within the school community provides students
              with a variety of “new things” and/or “other perspectives”—what Binder calls
              “globality”—as cultural capital. This “globality,” however, does not describe the
              degree of integration and entanglement of global experiences—the processes of
              transculturation—but views them as experiences gathered for future benefit. Likewise,
              the experiences described by Kressi are seen, by many students, as helpful for gaining
              a privileged position in the future. As sixteen-year-old Lara phrased it:</p>

            <p>Lara’s quote shows that growing up abroad and receiving an international education is
              linked to the idea of “globality” as cultural capital. Her way of imagining a future
              CV proves this particularly well. Nevertheless, the age-specific context has to be
              kept in mind, where parents play a major role in planning their children’s lives and
              making decisions in their “best interest” (see, for instance, the discussions about
              the move to Shanghai described in Part II, Chapter 1). Some attributions to the idea
              of “globality” drawn by Binder’s study on backpackers, such as the alternative
              experience of everyday life, and a special time for development and self-fulfillment
              are therefore not part of the expatriate youth’s sense of self. Youths consider being
              abroad a part of everyday life. The conceptualization of “globality” as the awareness
              of cultural resources that fit into globalized ways of living and subsequently serve
              as an important identity resource, however, is applicable to expatriate youths in
              Shanghai. It is the school that helps to provide, foster, and turn the youths’ global
              experiences into “globality” as part of their educational ambitions as well as part of
              establishing their community markers and values. As a result, these international
              schools ultimately foster an international community that can see itself as
              open-minded, diverse, and cosmopolitan without specifically including the local
              neighborhood, Shanghai, or China. These latter places are merely used as stages on
              which one experiences the differences contributing to their “globality.” While
              expatriate youths and their families thus create their own communities, which often
              revolve around schools, they practice demarcation towards “locals” in Shanghai as well
              as those back “home”—with both groups perceived as lacking international experience.
              Similar to how Brosius, investigating the everyday lives of India’s middle class,
              conceptualizes cosmopolitanism as “a practice of status-creation” (<xref rid="ID4c9106cb-6d90-4910-b3d4-8d81eeaa2302" ref-type="bibr" id="IDd3499b7e-f645-42fb-a578-83f841f2e9d5">2010, 26</xref>), the students and their
              families use the educational environment and the surrounding network to mediate their
              “expatriateness.”</p>
            <p>My three examples show how “expatriateness” is performed, maintained, and taught
              among expatriate youths who, under the influence of the international schools, and
              despite differences in their nationality, class, or ethnicity, create a distinct,
              unifying expatriate group consciousness. Looking at the everyday dimensions of
              transnational mobility at an international school, I highlight the significant amounts
              of energy, resources, and organization that go into building and sustaining a
              community with its distinct practices and norms. It becomes apparent that acquiring
              the habitus of an expatriate, to claim belonging to an expatriate community, goes hand
              in hand with processes of demarcation and a certain classism. While the habitus
              includes valuing cosmopolitanism and diversity, demarcation is an essential part in
              claiming these values and turning them into useful capital as “globality.” As David
              Ley has argued, “cosmopolitanism itself is always situated, always imbued with
              partiality and vulnerability” (<xref rid="IDdd559141-943d-45ed-a785-de7127b8eb7a" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeaf1a422-f3c3-4a0f-a8d2-23efcec802f0">Ley 2004, 162</xref>).
              The performance of a collective expatriate identity is thus not only tied to aspiring
              and learning cosmopolitan values, but simultaneously to practices of demarcation
              towards peers perceived as less mobile, globally connected, and educated. For many
              students, a school’s “nationality” does not necessarily correspond to their own, such
              that the school itself is seen as providing an added dimension of
              internationality.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, nationality, in addition to the choice of school, still provides a
              major marker along which various expatriate communities align themselves. It is
              therefore not surprising that access to a German school and the German expatriate
              community proved easier for me than it was to gain similar access to other (school)
              communities. While I have set my focus on the schools’ impact on the process of
              creating collective expatriate identities, it can also be said that sometimes, within
              expatriate communities, in Fechter’s words, “national boundaries are still anxiously
              guarded” (<xref rid="ID450c307e-721c-49c9-822f-cf213ba55ed4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID43e28658-56dd-4d87-83f0-82b2c5617f25">2007b, 110</xref>). Despite the efforts
              made to sustain a sense of community, the student body (as well as the staff and
              parents) at the different international schools is highly diverse and internal divides
              still exist. My discussions with teachers and students from the British and American
              international schools suggest that these internal dividing lines might be even
              stronger at schools with a larger student body and greater ethnic and national
              diversity than the German school I studied. Danau Tanu studied these hierarchical
              divides and the ideal of being “international” at an international school in Jakarta
              and succinctly summarizes these dynamics:</p>
            <p>
              <disp-quote id="dispquote43">
                <p>Money and cultural hierarchies influence perceptions and interactions that take
                  place on campus. Racial and other identity labels are sometimes used to signify
                  status and cultural difference, but their meanings constantly shift and at times
                  bear no semblance to actual physical appearance. Various forms of social assets,
                  such as language, accents, mannerisms, and money, are used to mark and vie for
                  status. Thus, being “international” is not a straightforward matter. International
                  schools may be a multicultural bubble, but it is a bubble that is not immune to
                  the dynamics at work in the world outside the school gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="ID3ab26948-ada5-40fe-b359-bc11996b6fb9" rid="IDd7270c8d-ae2f-40d4-a220-0829664cea3e">2011, 231</xref>).</p>

          <p>Peter bases his argument for school being “easier” on the privileged circumstances
            under which lessons take place. During the lessons I attended, I also observed small
            class sizes, new equipment, and teachers who address students (and their problems)
            individually, thus supporting those who have difficulties, rather than simply giving
            them a bad grade. Based on this learning environment, Peter consequently argues that
            many of his fellow students would not be able to succeed in the same way at other
            schools that would require much more assertiveness. While some students thus experience
            private schooling as a mark of privilege—a privilege that echoes the theme of comfort
            and luxury presented in my first example, “Everyday Comfort”—others feel this privilege
            is tied to pressure. Mia, for instance, who indirectly compares her school in Shanghai
            to elite schools in Germany and thus stresses her privileged form of education, also
            relates her school environment to a communal pressure to perform well.</p>

                  in Germany, but in general, if you just ask around, for instance when friends move
                  and then talk about their school, then you always think to yourself: “What? They
                  are happy about a 4 [equivalent to a D or a pass]?!”</italic>

          <p>The pressure to perform well can certainly be found among students elsewhere. Many
            expatriate youths, however, depict this pressure as particularly crucial to their school

            from the German school and a member of “the girls,” explain:</p>

          <p>When talking to me, the students (and those at the German school, in particular) often
            drew comparisons to schooling elsewhere, stressing the comparatively high expectations
            of their schools in Shanghai, as Paul’s, Mia’s, Britta’s, and Charlie’s remarks
            demonstrate. </p>
          <p>To delineate the various factors leading to such pressure (or at least the perception
            of it) I want to discuss Charlie’s perspective on schooling and pressure in detail and
            use her voice as one case-in-point. Charlie was sixteen when I first met her. Her
            parents were born in China and met in Germany during their studies at university.
            Charlie grew up in Germany and her parents took on German nationality. In the beginning
            of her high school years, her family decided to move to Shanghai. </p>
          <p>One day, when I interview Charlie out in the schoolyard during her free period, she
            abruptly changes the topic (we are discussing the rising taxi fares in China) and
            announces:</p>

                  semesters or so to get in. Then I would rather study something else. Because
                  medicine already takes so long, then I would already be, no idea, twenty. And when
                  I’m forty I would still be studying or something. Yes. That’s why I sometimes put
                  myself a little bit under pressure. And Antonia always puts herself under a lot of
                  pressure, too, because she, too, wants to study medicine. But her grades are
                  really good. She doesn’t even need to put herself under pressure. And then, when
                  I’m standing next to her and she starts to put herself under pressure—“I won’t
                  make it! I won’t make it!”—then I think, “Okay, I can just forget about it.” </italic>

          <p>Due to her wish to go to medical school in Germany, Charlie demands perfect scores and
            grades from herself. While she already has doubts about her success, the fact that
            others at her school also fear failing entrance into med school makes her feel even more
            pressured. </p>
          <p>When I discussed the high pressure to perform with teachers at the international
            schools, many pointed at the high involvement of parents in their children’s education.
            During my fieldwork, I also came across the idea of “tiger-mothers” (<xref rid="IDe71b12c8-341b-43ac-a216-5da5c4ee4419" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf0fa2f68-bbe8-4007-a8a2-e35e05fe0000">Chua 2011</xref>), those who constantly
            challenge their children by enrolling them in further educational activities from piano
            lessons to Chinese tutoring. There is indeed a hyperactivity in many students’ lives
            that seems to go hand-in-hand with expatriate (hyper)mobility; both are seen as
            beneficial for the development of the child. When I ask Charlie about her parents’ views

          <p>The pressure of parental expectations, as Charlie voices them, is something many
            students share regardless of where they are. I feel, however, that in the case of the
            expatriate teenagers in Shanghai, their parents, as successful transnational
            professionals, set the bar particularly high. Still, Charlie, a straight-A student,
            thinks her parents are not necessarily demanding too much. She explains to me that her
            parents were rather conservative and her father had voiced his thoughts that, if Charlie
            were a boy, he would be much stricter and his expectations for her grades would be much
            higher. “I think he already gave up on it a little bit,”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2173">138</xref> Charlie contemplates during our conversation in the schoolyard.
            When I voice my surprise about her father’s position, she elaborates:</p>

                  But my parents are actually pretty lenient. Well, for being Chinese parents.
                  &lt;L&gt; Because they also let me go party in the evenings. Well, they don’t like
                  it if I go out too often. But once in a while is okay. And they support it when I
                  do something with friends and so on. Just now they think studying for the Abitur
                  is the most important issue. But there are also parents who don’t allow that at
                  all.</italic>

          <p>Like Charlie, expat youths generally consider Chinese schooling to be hard and academic
            success more important for Chinese parents.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2218">140</xref>
            Consequently, at the schools, I regularly came across the prevailing conception among
            expat teenagers that those who have Chinese parents were automatically under more
            pressure than their peers from other backgrounds. Although friendships between students
            with Asian or non-Asian backgrounds were normal, I felt that having a Chinese parent was
            sometimes a dividing line that subtly underlay the shared experience of school. Through
            the eyes of the teenagers at the German school, for instance, high expectations from
            parents with Chinese roots are normal and also thought to indirectly influence the
            overall pressure to perform for all students in class. In school, a student’s
            “Chineseness” is thus often equated with diligent studying, learning to play an
            instrument, and abstinence from nightlife activities, due to the parents’ assumed
            objections. Students often play with these stereotypes and use them as a basis for
            jokes. They see their own international education as influenced by “Chinese” pressure
            and high expectations. Some students, mostly those who are relatively new to the
            expatriate community in Shanghai, voice their annoyance—sometimes by again “othering”
            students with Chinese backgrounds—about the pressure to perform.</p>

                  school] here [leads to] other things being pushed to the back that are actually
                  pretty important for enjoying life. I mean, I don’t live only to have achieved
                  something in sixty years. No friends, no contacts and then I die. That’s not the

          <p>Lara criticizes the importance her classmates place on having good grades. This
            emphasis is likely connected to the pressure to work hard for future success. This focus
            on the future is discussed in more detail in Part IV, Chapter 1. </p>
          <p>Privilege and pressure thus seem to have a dialectic relationship in the students’
            narratives and lives. The awareness of enjoying a privileged education and lifestyle,
            for some students, also carries with it the pressure to perform well. In all expatriate
            families, careers—and the education perceived as necessary to excel at them—are almost
            always viewed as highly important; they are considered worth the move to Shanghai to
            begin with. Unemployed parents are altogether unknown in the expatriate community. While
            the community is heterogeneous and class divides within Shanghai’s expatria of course
            exist, the international students also have no classmates whose parents have a
            working-class background. However, as I observed during my fieldwork at the German
            school, students are quite aware of the differences in degree of pressure exerted on
            students with Chinese versus Western backgrounds. </p>

          <title>3.5. Concluding thoughts on “expatriateness” and the role of schools</title>
          <p>This chapter examined expatriate youths’ shared experiences of belonging to an
            international school community—an experience that the student Allen, in the beginning of
            this chapter, described as everyone being in “the same space.” I described how this
            space is shaped by Shanghai’s specific international school landscape, which does not
            allow Chinese passport holders to enroll at any of these schools unless special
            circumstances exist. These schools are therefore almost hermetically sealed spaces. At
            the same time, as the second subsection illustrated, the schools put much effort into
            creating a shared experience for students. This building of a school community is based
            on establishing certain “social aesthetics” (<xref rid="IDc51805ed-90f0-4c37-a857-bbaa036d7ccd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID81cd82a6-1d71-4b08-b9fc-c2e296a123f1">MacDougall 2006</xref>) that involve a
            specific material culture and concrete everyday routines for students. The resulting
            school communities are all unified in the collective experience of belonging to an
            expatriate network in Shanghai. The schools here play a vital role in mediating what it
            means to be or act like an expatriate. In this way, the schools not only affect
            students’ lives, but also those of their families. They are community hubs for
            Shanghai’s expatria and offer parents an entrance to an expatriate community. I
            therefore argue that it is precisely in the spaces of the international schools that
            collective expatriate identities are negotiated and mediated on an everyday
            basis—through community events, communal valuing of the school as a site for the youths’
            (cosmopolitan) formation, and through the admission process that requires the “right”
            financial means or jobs, the “right” passports, and the “right” grades. The schools are
            seen as bringing together students from various international backgrounds, but—as with
            the gated communities—the diversity there is controlled. However, while the negotiations
            of collective expatriate identities forge a common consensus on what it means to be an
            expatriate in Shanghai, they do not always bridge internal divides, particularly along
            the lines of nationality or ethnicity, as the student discourse on the privilege and
            pressure of international education and the role of Chinese parents reveals. </p>
          <p>The controlled spaces of the schools are largely shaped by their institutional
            frameworks, but there are also places that teenagers seek out and shape on their own.
            These places are crucial for enabling teenagers to gain meaning and agency in their
            migration experience. As Massey (<xref rid="ID54e9bf6e-d5bd-442b-b2e1-10ec2231e331" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa15821b1-b4f9-41eb-a9e7-c184d18f1f9f">1995, 207</xref>)
            succinctly notes, “making of place is part of constructing the identity and coherence of
            the social group itself.” It is these reciprocal processes of space and age/group
            identity performances that the next part, “Arriving,” foregrounds, with the aim of
            further understanding how expatriate youth culture is caught in the dynamics of
            “uprootings and regroundings” (<xref rid="IDa1af01c3-ebc3-4b7f-8c0d-b0edeb29f719" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe092874c-c94f-4117-9b43-ad5cc8ce699f">Ahmed et al. 2003</xref>),

            <p>This part of the book examines expatriate teenagers’ narratives and practices
                of emplacement in Shanghai. While it continues to address the students as part of
                the expatriate community with its processes of demarcation and detachment from local
                Chinese communities, it zooms in on their particular age-specific spatial and social
                practices. I chose to foreground the youths’ efforts toward creating their own
                spaces, as I understand these to be crucial for teenagers to gain meaning and agency
                in their migration experience. I draw on Howes’ (2007) concept of emplacement
                to further understand how the expatriate youth cultures in Shanghai unfold in
                specific, everyday places and emerge in-between the dynamics of “uprootings
                and regroundings” (Ahmed et al. 2003). Howes stresses the importance of
                sensory experiences in everyday life and regards these as “a field of cultural
                elaboration” and “an arena for structuring social roles and
                interactions” (Howes 2007, xi). For my purposes, I interpret Howes’
                concept of emplacement as a means of grasping the physical experience of places, of
                being in and engaging with the “here and now.” I include in this
                interpretation the idea that how one experiences places simultaneously shapes
                one’s environment. This approach is in line with Howe’s argument that
                the process of emplacement is the counterpart to displacement, “the feeling
                that one is homeless, disconnected from one’s physical and social
                environment” (Howes [<xref rid="IDc41cbbe6-a78a-42e2-9d15-b99744a2db62" ref-type="bibr" id="ID222e2ac1-335a-4b19-a535-1d7c3f086402">2005</xref>] 2006,
                7). </p>
            <p>In the chapters that follow, I first discuss students’ conceptions of age
                identities (in Chapter 1) and then move on to their related spatial practices. The
                next two chapters in this part provide two specific examples of youths’ agency
                in creating their own spaces: going out (Chapter 2, on nightlife spaces) and hanging
                out at “the shop” (Chapter 3), a space on a small street close to
                school. These two spaces are in stark contrast to the gated communities and the
                schools presented in Part III, which contribute to the youths’ everyday
                experience of Shanghai being divided into “the city” and “expat
                spaces” (see Part III, Chapter 1). The schools and gated communities are
                characterized by what sociologist Zeiher (<xref rid="IDc007e18c-a488-417f-a127-c7e1c97b4391" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9e09fff0-836f-46f9-90cc-dabd8dc2639e">2003</xref>) has called
                ‘‘insularisation,” a term which refers to the increasing number of
                places particularly designed for children who move almost entirely between those
                places. While the expatriate teenagers also feel they are mostly being shuttled
                between gated communities and international school compounds, they choose and claim
                the two spaces presented here as their own. The analysis of these two spaces and the
                related construction of age identities also address the students’ overall
                perceptions and representations of the city of Shanghai. Chapter 4 closes this part
                of the book with an examination of the teenagers’ relations to Shanghai and
                its local citizens.</p>

                <p>Migration experiences are evidently age-specific, as the ethnographic vignettes
                    on the decision-making process about moving in Part II, Chapter 1 show. Older
                    siblings, for example, choose to stay, or at least consider staying, whereas
                    younger ones often have no choice. This part therefore discusses the role of age
                    in the migration process by investigating the reflections and the
                    teenagers’ age-related identity performances and ties them to current
                    academic debates on youth that were addressed earlier, in the Introduction.</p>

                    <p> I am sitting outside, in a rather undisturbed corner of the schoolyard, on a
                        few steps behind the track, listening to Karina and Lara’s accounts of
                        their move to Shanghai about seven months prior. Although it is only the end
                        of February, the sunshine is bright and warm. While the three of us enjoy
                        these first moments of spring, the two girls, like many of my interviewees,
                        explain why they feel it was simply the wrong time for them to move abroad. </p>

                            <p><italic> The younger you are the less painful it is, I think. I
                                    don’t know. When I was eight years old we moved to [a town
                                    in Northern China]. When my mother told me about it I was really
                                    happy. Right? Every day I asked: “Has dad signed the
                                    contract yet? Can we finally go to China?” and so on.
                                    Because, I was younger, and I wanted to experience something.
                                    But the older you get, the stronger your relations to others
                                    become. Somehow. I don’t know, you get used to them. When
                                    you then get separated from them, I wasn’t happy any more.
                                    Yippee off to China. Instead, I just screamed at my father.
                                    Because it just sucked.</italic>

                    <p>Both Karina and Lara, seventeen and sixteen years old, believe that age plays
                        a role in the difficulties of moving, arguing that adolescence seems a
                        particularly bad time. Lara explains:</p>

                                It is more difficult. I just experienced that. At my age it just
                                sucks. You have your friends, your boyfriend, whatever.

                    <p>Transnational mobility challenges not only relations to places, but also
                        relationships. As both quotes from the discussion with Karina and Lara show,
                        the two students argue that because relationships to peers grow stronger
                        over the years as one becomes more independent from parents, the move abroad
                        becomes more difficult. Both also point out that school makes it more
                        difficult to move in their mid- or late-teens. They emphazise that moving in
                        the final years before graduation gives them less time to adjust to the new
                        environment, since grades often already count for the final diploma—a
                        major issue that Britta from Norway also repeatedly stressed during my
                        interview with her at the British school.</p>
                    <p>While most teenagers think of adolescence as the wrong time to move, however,
                        they may also see it as the right time to be in Shanghai. The mega-city
                        offers numerous bars and clubs that commonly do not enforce any age-based
                        entry restrictions. The youths often take this opportunity to explore
                        nightlife to a degree that is usually impossible for their peers in Europe
                        or Northern America. Britta explains: </p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="speech223">
                            <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                            <p> There is so much nightlife, there is so much fun. ‘Cause in
                                Norway you have to be eighteen or twenty-one to get into the club.
                            </p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>The absence of enforced age restrictions in China’s nightlife spaces
                        makes the stay attractive for teenagers, who are in the process of exploring
                        their age identities. Chapter 2 therefore provides detailed descriptions of
                        these nightlife practices. </p>
                    <p>But regardless of their exciting nightlife options, like Karina, most of my
                        informants perceive and convey adolescence as a difficult time to move.
                        Moreover, they differentiate being a teenager from being a child and argue
                        that the losses experienced by younger children are less severe and that
                        their integration at a new school is easier. The students I interviewed seem
                        to be familiar with—and even reiterate—the notion that children
                        are simply part of a family, without any social ties of their own. This goes
                        hand in hand with concepts that see children as not yet fully-developed
                        human beings. Such approaches have lately been criticized and
                        re-conceptualized in anthropology and related disciplines (<xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="ID86789f3b-5676-4cbd-acd9-16ffaf72cf5a">Bucholtz 2002</xref>; <xref rid="IDd7c74262-237b-479f-b7ee-0f40a16b7d44" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc2441fad-b1ef-4d61-a8cf-6af37a321072">Hutchins 2011, see also the

                        personal social ties impact the move. I believe that the older teenagers
                        emphasize their distinction from the younger children, as for instance Lara
                        and Karina do when talking about the difficulties of moving, in order to
                        stress the importance of their own social lives and ties and to counteract
                        being perceived as having none. </p>
                    <p>The two seemingly contradicting discourses presented here—that of
                        adolescence being the wrong time for moving, but the right time for living

                        perform and manifest the specific age identities of someone who is gradually
                        outgrowing the realm of the family.</p>

                        now”</title>
                    <p>As shown in earlier parts of the book, experiences abroad are often
                        considered to be beneficial capital for the future: the hardship of moving
                        at an early age will pay off when the children grow up and enter
                        professional life. This focus on development for future benefit is common
                        when discussing young people’s lives and underlies the idea of
                        adolescence. Mary Bucholtz (<xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe23f8c31-b6e2-4678-8def-c8b4b7fab9d4">2002</xref>) has argued that
                        anthropological and sociological works on adolescence often see this
                        development as a staging ground for integration into the adult community.
                        Conceptualizations of this kind frame young people’s own cultural
                        practices solely in relation to adult concerns. Bucholtz has consequently
                        called for a shift, not only terminologically but also theoretically, from
                        the anthropology of adolescence to the anthropology of youth. She aims at
                        research practices that focus on youth’s own perspectives and that
                        distance themselves from the conceptualization of adolescence as merely a
                        phase dedicated to leading towards adulthood: “Where the study of
                        adolescence generally concentrates on how bodies and minds are shaped for
                        adult futures, the study of youth emphasizes instead the here-and-now of
                        young people’s experience, the social and cultural practices through
                        which they shape their worlds” (Bucholtz <xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8919c20f-eab3-4f3f-84eb-415d2988ce51">2002</xref>, 532).</p>
                    <p>Bucholtz’s argument is echoed by Allison and Adrian James, who find
                        that society’s (and often research’s) focus on children’s
                        futures “detract[s] from the recognition of the importance of
                        children’s experiences of the present and the significance of these
                        experiences in shaping the adults they will become” (<xref rid="ID01d18802-2a4a-4a26-8c38-1cc55f63db68" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb8c5c92e-1041-422a-b02f-b3b3114e8d74">2008, 64–65</xref>).
                        The source of this focus on children’s and adolescents’ futures
                        James and James see in society’s interest in securing people’s
                        contributions in the years to come:</p>

                        his own future-driven social status as a teenager.</p>
                    <p>While I, in the future-oriented status of a PhD candidate (routinely facing
                        questions such as “What do you want to do afterwards?”), might
                        have been particularly sensitive to the pressures of planning and working
                        hard for the future, the expatriate youths seldom verbalized this pressure
                        directly. Reading between the lines, however, their worries over what to
                        study or which career to pursue hinted at the future-orientedness that
                        underlies expatriate youth’s experiences in Shanghai. While pondering
                        the loaded question of what lies ahead (for my subjects and myself), I came
                        across an art project by the German student Andrea entitled “My time
                        is now.” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21"> (Figure 21).</xref> </p>

                    <p>The art project consists of several photographs showing children and
                        teenagers holding up or standing in front of a sign that displays, line
                        after line, the text “My time is now,” as well as students
                        wearing a white t-shirt with the same text. In many cases, a group of
                        students or individuals look into the camera, laughing or enjoying
                        themselves. To secure the anonymity of students, however, I only include
                        images from Andrea’s project that do not reveal faces (Figure

                    <p> In the context of preparing for future moves, education, and jobs, the
                        message: “My time is now” seems like a stop sign, an appeal to

                        several months back in Germany, that I arranged an interview with Andrea to

                            They always like to draw attention to their community and so on, their
                            school life—practically like a publicity campaign. That’s
                            extremely embarrassing, sometimes. Then I thought this would be
                            appreciated at our school. And it was, by teachers and so on. So I
                            proceeded like this: okay, now I do a project, [and] because I am not a
                            good photographer, [it] doesn’t need to be photographically
                            convincing. But it can allude a little bit to us being one school,
                            “sheltered and grown together” [referring to the school
                            slogan] and so on. Because it’s not really German to represent
                            yourself like that, I thought my teachers might pick up on that. And erm

&lt;L&gt;, everything was really pretty cheesy. And then I used Google
                            to see what kind of quotes exist, because I wanted to do something with
                            text and photography. Well and then “My time is now”
                            appeared, which is really perfect. And a bit too kitschy. And then I
                            made this t-shirt. I thought, “Okay, then they can wear that or
                            hold it.”                                […] And this sign. And then I walked around school
                            and asked a few students to help me. And then I asked my friends if they
                            would help me, because I don’t like being like: “Hello, my
                                name is Andrea! We are &lt;x&gt;.” Of course I put some effort
                            into involving some French students, because it refers even more to this
                            social inclusion that is so popular at every school in Germany.</italic>

                    <p>While I had interpreted the art project as a statement against the pressure
                        to focus on the future and as an appeal to look at the moment in Shanghai,
                        my interview with Andrea pointed in a different direction. Her approach to
                        the project had been more that of a designer working at a marketing agency,
                        with customers—the teachers and the school—clearly in mind when
                        choosing the theme and producing the images. However, the success of her
                        images within the school also shows in what fertile ground Andrea had
                        planted her idea: her claim, “My time is now,” was used for the
                        whole school’s art project that would later win a state-sponsored
                        award for the school’s arts program (see Part III, Chapter 3, where I
                        comment on the movie that her schoolmate Kressi shot for the awards
                        ceremony). Andrea’s photography project rendered the
                        future-orientedness in the students’ lives visible to educators and
                        the school community.</p>

                    <title>1.3. Rejecting “old people”—claiming spaces</title>
                    <p>While the expatriate students like to emphasize their own social
                        ties—for instance when talking about the experience of moving to
                        Shanghai, as Karina’s and Lara’s narratives in the beginning of
                        this chapter demonstrate—one should not be tempted to read their
                        acknowledgement of these ties as evidence of their wanting to be
                        “adults.” Their practices of distinguishing themselves from
                        younger children are not aimed at their being seen as “adults,”
                        but rather as “youths.” This becomes clear in their disapproval
                        of “old people” and their practices, an attitude which I came
                        across several times during fieldwork encounters and interviews, as the
                        following excerpt of a discussion with Antonia and Olivia on nightlife
                        spaces illustrates.</p>

                    <p>The two girls’ annoyance, which in this case centers on “old men
                        at the bar,” stems from their perception that “old people”
                        occupy or interfere with spaces that they have claimed as their own. I argue
                        that they make this claim to distinguish themselves from adults and
                        simultaneously find ways to counteract the lingering pressure to focus on
                        their future. In short, the students identify nightclubs as a space of
                        youth. The following chapter further investigates the role of nightlife in
                        youths’ constructions of age-identities as well as in their
                        emplacement in Shanghai.</p>

                <title>Chapter 2: Nightlife : Going Out</title>
                <sec>
                    <title>2.1. Shanghai’s nightlife spaces</title>
                    <p>This chapter shows how Shanghai’s nightscapes are a crucial platform
                        for the identity negotiations of expatriate youths. While not all students
                        participate in nightlife activities,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e422">150</xref> clubbing practices are nevertheless pivotal because they are
                        central to teenagers’ involvement with the city; they are also an
                        important form of coming to terms with the move to Shanghai. Here, teenagers
                        claim new spaces collectively, and without the inclusion of their families.
                        In exploring these practices, this chapter first analyzes Shanghai’s
                        nightlife spaces in general to examine the conditions it presents to the
                        teenage patrons. Considering that, in Shanghai, there are—de
                        facto—no age-based restrictions to clubs or bars, I first examine the
                        resulting heated debates on teenage nightlife practices in the expatriate
                        community, as well as students’ accounts of negotiating parental
                        concern in the second section. The next section gives a detailed description
                        of teenagers’ habits when they go out, based on participant
                        observations as well as interviews. Based on the Friday night routine at a
                        club called Mural, it analyzes how going out is a break from the school
                        routine, a means to play with and affirm their age, gender, cosmopolitan,
                        and urban identities, and a way to stregthen friendships. The fourth and
                        final section concludes the analysis of the role of nightlife spaces in
                        teenage expatriates’ experiences of their stay in Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>When entering bars or clubs in Shanghai, I often feel like many of them could
                        be in any large city or tourist location. The menu displays the same
                        cocktails, wines, and liquors that are offered elsewhere. Occasionally,
                        local beers, mostly <italic>Qingdao</italic>, are presented along with
                        international beer brands. The music played, although varying between
                        locations in Shanghai, is typical of mainstream party locations in Europe.
                        People’s attire depends on the locations’ dress codes, which are
                        implicitly or openly stated: the men often wear dress shirts and the women
                        display more skin and make-up than during the day. Everyone seems to be
                        engaged in practices familiar from nightlife locations in Europe: chatting,
                        drinking, and sometimes dancing. One finds the same tastes, same sounds,
                        same visuals, and same practices. Thus, Shanghai offers a very international
                        dance club scene.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e433">151</xref> My own
                        immediate familiarity with all these sensory impressions and patterns
                        confirms James Farrer’s (<xref rid="IDaa1cf9f0-6452-4e2d-af50-825da053aac2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf2d3b5e6-66bd-4a9f-b785-0b2740865648">2011</xref>)
                        conceptualization of Shanghai’s bars and clubs as belonging to a
                        “global nightscape.” The idea is based on Appadurai’s
                            (<xref rid="IDed4b8639-d012-4faf-be21-388e373e83af" ref-type="bibr" id="ID174d8d51-70d6-4100-905a-d22207744cd0">1990, 296</xref>)
                        understanding of the global cultural economy and its “dimensions of
                        global cultural flow.” In Farrer’s (<xref rid="IDaa1cf9f0-6452-4e2d-af50-825da053aac2" ref-type="bibr" id="ID21476c26-d72d-4a84-a35b-f173f13267bb">2011, 748</xref>) words, the
                        concept refers primarily to “the ways in which these local urban
                        nightscapes are sites of transnational flows.” Additionally, these
                        global nightscapes—to use Farrer’s description which is based on
                        Chatterton and Hollands’s (<xref rid="ID04293b82-5cad-404b-95d1-c4cd3c435724" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4876e4dd-d1af-48c2-be05-be44ab3f3023">2003</xref>)
                        findings—are “constructed through globalising cultural and
                        corporate processes that homogenise and stratify nightlife
                        experiences” (<xref rid="IDaa1cf9f0-6452-4e2d-af50-825da053aac2" ref-type="bibr" id="ID570d382f-d0a7-4627-b7ef-75f5019ac067">Farrer 2011,
                            748</xref>). Farrer succinctly points out the consequences of emerging
                        global nightscapes for foreign visitors: “Pragmatically, nightlife
                        globalisation means that anyone familiar with nightlife in other global
                        cities could pick his or her way through Shanghai's global nightscapes with
                        relative ease upon landing in the city, using the categories of spaces
                        learned already in similar settings” (<xref rid="IDaa1cf9f0-6452-4e2d-af50-825da053aac2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa77f8133-1d68-4db0-852d-323e590d2cb7">Farrer 2011, 748</xref>). </p>
                    <p>There are locations in Shanghai, such as Karaoke bars, clubs with big seating
                        areas and small dance floors, beverages which must be ordered by the bottle,
                        and those where people play Chinese drinking games based on dice rolling,
                        which offer unfamiliar experiences to the foreign visitor. The expatriate
                        youths, however, mostly choose clubs that are very international in terms of
                        sounds, drinks, and practices. If they go to clubs that they label as
                        “more Chinese,” they still pursue their familiar ways of
                        partying. In general, Shanghai offers many locations that follow such a
                        pattern of nightlife aimed toward a global audience; these locations are
                        easy for me and the students alike to navigate.</p>
                    <p>Nightlife in Shanghai, however, is only easy to navigate to those who can
                        afford it: the drinks cost as much as a meal for two in a local restaurant,
                        the cover charges are high, and taxi rides are necessary because the subway
                        and most buses stop running at eleven p.m. Consequently, the majority of
                        clubs are only affordable to the upper-middle classes of Shanghai.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e450">152</xref> Despite—or maybe even
                        because of—this stratification, I argue that, given the spaces’
                        orientation toward profit, all the clubs and bars we visited fit into Paul
                        Chatterton and Robert Hollands’s (<xref rid="ID04293b82-5cad-404b-95d1-c4cd3c435724" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbef65424-7ad5-4cb2-94ee-5f7ce3605e80">2003</xref>) definition of
                        “mainstream.” In their book Urban Nightscapes, Chatterton and
                        Hollands argue that city nightlife today is characterized by
                        “mainstream production, through the corporatisation of ownership via
                        processes of branding and theming” as well as “regulation,
                        through practices which increasingly aid capital accumulation and urban
                        image-building.” These practices simultaneously heighten surveillance
                        and “consumption, through new forms of segmented nightlife activity
                        driven by processes of gentrification and the adoption of 'upmarket'
                        lifestyle identities among groups of young adults” (<xref rid="ID04293b82-5cad-404b-95d1-c4cd3c435724" ref-type="bibr" id="ID60476678-4048-42ed-a1dd-2b39bce2e46c">Chatterton and Hollands
                            2003, 7</xref>). Chatterton and Hollands’s analysis is concerned
                        with nightlife spaces in Great Britain; however, the processes of theming,
                        urban-image building, surveillance, and gentrification are also prominent in
                        Shanghai, and not only in its nightlife spaces. In preparation for the World
                        Expo in 2010, the city underwent a degree of polishing, which also
                        stimulated gentrification projects in areas such as the former French
                        concession.</p>
                    <p>As competitive and future-oriented as Shanghai presented itself to be in
                        hosting the expo, it simultaneously shines brightly with nostalgia,
                        particularly at night. High-end restaurants, bars, and clubs in Shanghai are
                        often located either in old buildings of the former French concession, or in
                        those along Shanghai’s waterfront, the Bund. Thus, the physical
                        locations of nightlife spaces build upon the city’s colonial past.
                        Some places are even restored to their former glory, i.e. the premises of
                        the former Shanghai Club located at the Bund, the principal men’s club
                        for British residents of colonial Shanghai during its heyday in the 1920s
                        and 1930s, famous for its thirty-four-meter-long bar. The Waldorf Astoria
                        that now runs the building rebuilt the “long bar” after
                        photographs from 1911 and re-opened it in October <xref rid="ID985b5dc7-cc6c-4601-a7b7-29bd40a82cc4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0b3acd63-b136-44ce-a733-0be22ac15c22">2010</xref> (<xref rid="ID985b5dc7-cc6c-4601-a7b7-29bd40a82cc4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6788cc9b-eb25-4332-92b5-6a528e19c07b">McDermott 2010</xref>). Many

                        transportation or the financial means to afford a night out—and
                        directly—through policies such as age-control (<xref rid="IDb5995c57-1baa-48d2-910a-b60799d34655" ref-type="bibr" id="ID198df6d5-9a57-4b5f-b23c-eb7c6cea1ea4">Valentine 2003, 38</xref>).
                        For teenagers in the contemporary North, for instance, the law usually
                        prohibits their consumption of alcohol and consequently restricts their
                        participation in nightlife spaces. Accepting Valentine’s (<xref rid="IDb5995c57-1baa-48d2-910a-b60799d34655" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9ca263e4-fb54-4eca-b153-5f10b7b0c62b">2003</xref>) observations
                        that a lack of personal funds and independent transportation, as well as
                        laws and policies, restricts many youths’ access to nightlife spaces,
                        I will now consider more closely how these aspects come into play in
                        Shanghai. </p>
                    <p>Students in Shanghai stress that restrictions are comparably fewer in China
                        than they are elsewhere. Lacking funds is less of a problem, too. Many
                        common items and services that would cost the same or more in Germany are
                        affordable for the students in Shanghai, given their parents’
                        income—and despite those items being relatively expensive by the local
                        economy’s standards. As I described in Part II, Chapter 1
                        “Making sense of the city,” access to transportation is also
                        comparably easy. Returning home late in Shanghai—even after the
                        subways system closes at eleven p.m.—proves easy, because taxis are
                        readily available and affordable for expat youth. Not only transportation,
                        but also safety, according to the two students Peter and Marco, is less of a
                        concern here than in Germany.</p>

                                know what to pay attention to. I’ve heard things like the last

                                Germany, everyone all of a sudden leaves at twelve. Well, and here
                                some leave at one, others at four. Also because of the safety, you
                                can just walk somewhere. You could get lost and wouldn’t be

                    <p>While some students come up with strategies to overcome parental authority
                        with the help of friends, a few students simply rebel and act against their
                        parents’ guidelines. Seventeen-year-old Paul, for instance,

                            <p> Well, my parents didn’t know. We snuck out. And eventually

                    <p>In the same interview, however, Paul also admits that, for this behavior, he
                        was grounded for a whole school year from any nightlife activity. These
                        stories seem to be the parental nightmares that circulate among the
                        expatriate community and fuel images of unruly teens. </p>
                    <p>Nightlife and alcohol consumption among teenagers are seen as a severe
                        problem in the parental expatriate community in Shanghai. While a full
                        discourse analysis is beyond the scope of this ethnography, I gained an
                        overview based on local expatriate magazines, discussions with the community
                        organization Shanghai Lifeline, an interview with a school counselor, and
                        observations at talks targeted at expatriate parents. The discussions on
                        teenage nightlife practices in Shanghai can be seen as oscillating between
                        debates on health concerns on the one hand and what might be considered
                        moral panic on the other. </p>
                    <p>The easy access to clubs and bars, health concerns, and fear of possible
                        alcohol addiction, for instance, are discussed in detail in the article
                        “Teenage Drinking” in the Summer 2007 issue of <italic>City
                            Weekend: Shanghai Parents and Kids</italic>. The article teaser warns:
                        “Buying alcohol in a convenience store is as easy as buying soda. With
                        alcohol abuse on the rise amongst teenagers in Shanghai, a 16-year-old teen
                        and his mother share their story” (<xref rid="ID40fe8702-8ea3-4ec8-a89a-de304efdedb1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID77d456a4-2057-449f-8586-1875bff9597a">Cheng 2007</xref>). Many
                        articles and talks given to the community are targeted at parents. I was not
                        surprised to see the announcement for an event entitled “Sex, Drugs,
                        and Rock ‘n’ Roll” at an international school in Pudong in
                        the fall of 2010. The evening event, well-attended by parents, hosted a
                        social worker and a speaker from the British Consulate. They gave insights
                        into how to talk with teens about alcohol and drugs, and about the legal
                        consequences of drug abuse in China. Parents were particularly concerned
                        about clarifying rumors that an entire family could be deported from Chinese
                        territory if one of their children was caught in possession of drugs. </p>
                    <p>Measures aiming to counteract alcohol abuse among teenagers have also been
                        taken. In 2010, a telephone help-line service targeted at expatriates called
                        Shanghai Lifeline, was in the midst of establishing workshops for youths to
                        inform, counteract, and/or prevent alcohol or drug abuse. Likewise, the
                        Community Center Shanghai established a program called Interkom in 2007,
                        which was advertised as a program that “provides a positive
                        alternative to the rise of drug and alcohol abuse and accessibility to high
                        risk activities to international teens in Shanghai” (<italic><xref rid="IDd8b12edd-d64d-4589-b037-55af4fad520b" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc729ac0e-ffbd-4805-8122-10d4399212ad">Community Center

                        the Shanghai Lifeline project, also managed to influence certain restaurants
                        in the Jinqiao expatriate residential areas to refrain from providing
                        alcohol to minors by threatening to blacklist these locations—mostly
                        western-style family restaurants—within the expatriate community. Some
                        of the international schools have reacted to the open bars and the heated
                        debate among Shanghai’s expatria by introducing regular drug testing. </p>
                    <p>While these discussions very likely take place in other countries and
                        environments as well, these negotiations seem particularly present for
                        expatriate families in Shanghai because parents are the only de facto
                        regulating authorities. An article entitled “Shanghai’s
                        Tormented Teens,” Global Times China, an online newspaper, reviewed a
                        talk by a Shanghai-based doctor, Tim Kelly, on understanding teenagers.
                        Kelly noted that “often families find that whatever were vulnerable
                        points before coming to Shanghai, like arguments about curfews and homework,
                        become exacerbated here” (<xref rid="ID6be6da29-35f2-4efc-8ff0-6c52d706c3f6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa0ec88fe-b26c-4f7b-9645-9784572cf249">Peterson 2011</xref>). </p>
                    <p>From the teenagers’ perspectives, however, nightlife is an ideal way to
                        forge ties with their peers. I observed that students who are not allowed
                        (or willing) to accompany their peers to nightlife activities are pitied by
                        their classmates and sometimes have difficulty positioning themselves within
                        their class or certain peer groups. It is also noteworthy that, in this
                        context, my relationships with the teenagers whom I regularly joined for
                        nightlife activities became closer than those of the other students I
                        interviewed and resulted in further invitations to participate in
                        activities.</p>

                    <p>The last two subchapters described Shanghai’s nightscapes as global,
                        mainstream, and having links to Shanghai’s past, as well as the
                        absence of age-based restrictions to clubs and alcohol and the resulting
                        negotiations between parents and teenagers. In this section, I highlight one
                        specific place that is popular among the groups from the German school: a
                        club called Mural. The club was by far the one students frequented most,
                        which is why a detailed description and analysis of how the teenagers’
                        nightlife practices and the meanings embedded in them were acted out in this
                        specific location offer important insights. I discuss seven aspects that are
                        relevant for understanding the teenagers’ typical nights out at Mural:
                        1. The social aesthetics of the club, 2. Friday night as a marker between
                        school routines and the weekend, 3. How the club and its open bar allow
                        teenagers to play with age identities, 4. The gendered ways of going out, 5.
                        Nightlife practices as a group activity, 6. Nightlife spaces as stages for
                        cosmopolitan performances, and 7. Going out as an urban experience.</p>

                            Their regular visits to Mural, the repetition of certain practices
                            there, and the students’ familiarity with the physical
                            surroundings contribute to the formation of what David MacDougall (<xref rid="IDef1f2770-65ae-4ab1-8e85-6a994aa77bc5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID82e3187d-95ae-4574-9d00-b932876edb10">2006</xref>) refers to
                            as a “shared aesthetic space” among the teenagers. Drawing
                            again on MacDougall’s concept of “social aesthetics,”
                            which describes “the creation of an aesthetic space or sensory
                            structure” (<xref rid="IDef1f2770-65ae-4ab1-8e85-6a994aa77bc5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID64dcec12-2625-403d-bdd2-c0b98c4561c9">ibid.,
                                105</xref>), I depict here the material environment as well as
                            practices that shape the experience of a night at Mural. MacDougall does
                            not understand “aesthetics” in the traditional sense, that
                            is as notions about beauty or art, but as a “wider range of
                            culturally patterned sensory experience” (<xref rid="IDef1f2770-65ae-4ab1-8e85-6a994aa77bc5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID38aad986-867c-4052-a2d7-b4c832bc199b">ibid., 98</xref>). He
                            sees the social aesthetic field as the coalescence of different
                            elements, such as objects and actions, and finds it a “physical
                            manifestation of the largely internalized and invisible ‘embodied
                            history’ that Bourdieu calls habitus” (<xref rid="IDef1f2770-65ae-4ab1-8e85-6a994aa77bc5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID92e75ae6-e8bd-4b97-806c-60c6abe75360">2006, 98</xref>). While
                            MacDougall applies his concept to a boarding school in India, I believe
                            certain social aesthetics of a nightclub can be experienced similarly.

                            social aesthetics, describes how a shared space is created in nightclubs
                            not only through sensory experiences (lighting, music, physical
                            proximity to others), but also through the repetition of certain
                            practices. Malbon (<xref rid="IDe68dd3b5-b6bf-4316-aa42-9af2b14e311a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID19998473-a647-4a23-9ab7-2a1efa2d88bd">1998,
                                276</xref>) argues: “Acting out certain roles, dressing in a
                            similar manner, dancing in a certain way, even drinking similar beers
                            are all ways in which the affinity of the group can be reinforced, the
                            territory of the club experience claimed.” In this creation of
                            certain social aesthetics, Malbon (<xref rid="IDe68dd3b5-b6bf-4316-aa42-9af2b14e311a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID21e448d7-b071-4547-8b52-b4dbdae4ed90">1998, 280</xref>) also
                            thinks that clubbers actively shape their experience: “the club
                            situation offers clubbers opportunities to inscribe their own
                            creativities upon a shared space to create a space of their own making
                            of which they are also the consumers.” What kind of social
                            aesthetic, with its patterns and emotional effects, does a Friday night
                            at Mural hold for expatriate youths?</p>
                        <p>Mural lies in the heart of the city, just off Hengshan Road, a popular
                            bar and boutique street that was already central during the time of the
                            former French concession, and underwent large-scale renovation in the
                            first two decades of the twenty-first century. The bar is conveniently
                            located near a subway station and is close to restaurants and some local
                            shops. In the evenings, street vendors selling cigarettes greet you
                            outside as you enter the building and proceed down the stairs to the
                            basement. The club itself is spacious, features a long bar, a section
                            with tables and chairs, another area with couches and low tables, and an
                            elevated dance floor. There are no windows and the lighting is
                            unobtrusive, with tea lights on the tables adding to the atmosphere.
                            Mural’s owners present the bar on their website using images of
                            the location sitting empty, with tastefully-arranged furniture and
                            enveloped in a warm light. The accompanying text informs the online

                        </p>
                        <p>My personal impression of the club was quite different. While the
                            cave-like atmosphere is strongly supported by its basement location, the
                            theme “5000 years of history” is easily forgotten when the
                            place is packed to its limits on a Friday night. Interestingly, the
                            “mix of Chinese tradition and western new age” is attempted
                            not only through decorations such as wooden tablets adorned with old
                            Chinese text, but also through Sanskrit words and depictions of sutras
                            on the stone walls. These decorations, however, seem to regularly
                            disappear behind clubgoers. Students could not recall these wall
                            decorations in detail when I asked about them, despite regularly
                            spending their Friday nights in the club. The social aesthetics of the
                            bar are also tied to specific events and their themes. Mural hosts a
                            ladies’ night on Wednesdays and a salsa night every Monday. It is
                            only on Fridays, however, that the two groups of friends, “the
                            girls” and “the boys” (see Part I, Chapter 3), choose
                            Mural as their standard location <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22"> (Figure 22).</xref> </p>
                        <p>Every Friday night, Mural hosts an open bar. Its website announces this
                            weekly event as “Up Your Funk,” and underlines this with the
                            call “Free ya mind … and ya ass will follow.”
                            This, the website assures its visitors, will be achieved by the
                            “hottest DJs” and the open bar. The music usually consists
                            of a mix between soul, funk, disco, and other genres, going through
                            different phases as the evening progresses. A dress code is not enforced
                            and jeans, sneakers, or t-shirts hinder no one from entering. Guests are
                            mainly in their twenties. I estimate the ratio of Chinese and foreign
                            patrons attending the club on Friday nights at roughly 1:2. The
                            proportion of female to male clubgoers is comparable. The open bar means
                            that the cover charge of RMB 100 (€11) covers all drinks, from
                            soft drinks and beer, to cocktails and liquor. At the bar, you are
                            served the first three kinds of drinks, while guests are given two
                            different kinds of shots at a special table set up next to the entrance
                            and the cloakroom. “The boys” always book a table with three
                            couches in advance. This couch section serves as home base during the
                            evening for both “the girls” and “the boys.”
                            Students come and go, moving back and forth between the bar, dance
                            floor, and the stairs just outside the club. The open bar ends at two
                            a.m., usually leading to many guests going home or moving on to the next
                            location. </p>
                        <p>For the students, the most important parts of the club are arguably the
                            people, music, the couches, and the special setting of the open bar on
                            Friday nights. As their favorite club, Mural produces, through its
                            location, decor, drinks, and guests’ practices of dressing and
                            socializing, a specific landscape that the students perceive as
                            particularly “relaxed.”</p>

                            the practices of going out, dancing, and consuming alcohol as markers
                            between the school-week and the weekend for these teenagers, who often
                            conceptualize nightlife in the same way: </p>

                                    the week. I couldn’t do without it. That would be too
                                    boring.  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e831">158</xref></p>
                            </speech>
                        </p>
                        <p>Linked to this understanding of Friday night routines as rituals to mark
                            the transition from the tightly-structured school-week to the weekend,
                            teenagers also put forth the idea of partying as a reward for working
                            hard in school.</p>
                        <p>The Friday night routine usually starts with a shared taxi ride to the
                            downtown area—I never witnessed anyone taking the metro to go out.
                            Sometimes, students also dine out together before clubbing. For
                            “the girls,” the night often begins with communal dressing
                            up. The appropriate party outfit is an important ingredient of the
                            nightlife experience and supports the break between week and weekend.
                            When I join the group for the first time on a night out in January 2011,
                            meeting them at Mural after having texted Antonia who invited me, I feel
                            a little bit out of place and have trouble determining which topics and
                            practices are appropriate. My early field notes from this night out
                            later remind me of these beginnings: “The girls were also dressed
                            accordingly: high heels, tight leggings, short skirts or leopard-print
                            dresses … I felt a bit clumsy in my jeans and sneakers next
                            to those sixteen-year-old beauties, all dressed up for their night
                            out” (fieldnotes, January 2011).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e846">159</xref>
                            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e849">160</xref>
                        </p>
                        <p>I naively thought that jeans and sneakers would be appropriate for a
                            rather casual place like Mural. But while the club does not demand a
                            certain dress code, the girls enjoy the ritual of dressing up. They even
                            document this ritual on Facebook by posting photos of themselves with
                            eyelash curlers, before their bathroom mirrors. Through different
                            clothes and drinks, the weekend is thus conjured up and the school
                            world, which poses particular social relationships for the teens, is
                            transformed into the entirely different sphere of weekend nightlife.</p>

                        <title>Acting mature: from teen to club guest</title>
                        <p>During their Friday nights at Mural, some students like to stay on the
                            couches, drinking, smoking, chatting, and listening to music, while
                            others enjoy themselves on Mural’s elevated dance floor. The
                            students get up in turns to stand in line at the bar to fetch beers or
                            long drinks, or, occasionally, to get a round of shots at the small bar
                            for the group. Similar to how Gusfield (<xref rid="IDff229630-4fd1-425b-8b50-514fa542cb3f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7af3583e-7f47-447e-aeea-0eb816fb7911">1987, 81</xref>)
                            describes that, by buying rounds, “each person takes
                            responsibility for payment of the drink of all members of the group, no
                            matter what his own consumption will be or has been,” the open bar
                            allows the teenagers to provide their friends with drinks and to show
                            they care for their group without having to ask their friends for money
                            or put a strain on their allowance <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23"> (Figure 23).</xref> </p>
                        <p>Thus the attractiveness of the open bar does not necessarily lie in the
                            possibility of binge drinking or getting drunk cheaply, but rather in
                            the way it allows the teenagers to foster ties with their friends. When
                            they bring each other drinks, teenagers strengthen the overall
                            interaction within the group and feel that they have provided for each
                            other. Without having to worry about spending too much, each person can
                            get something for everyone, and feel he or she has contributed equally. </p>
                        <p>By enabling teenagers to “buy” drinks for others, the open
                            bar at Mural also provides the youths with a space to practice
                            “typical” adult patron behaviors that they might associate
                            with nightlife spaces. This testing and practicing of
                            “appropriate” ways to behave in bars and clubs is similar to
                            sociologist Yuki Kato’s (<xref rid="ID730261c2-ad8a-4613-9a33-5ad34c3331fe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID02996283-8888-4e5f-ad03-817599b67257">2009</xref>)

                            By exploring the two different practices of “sitting cars”
                            (how a group of teenagers she studied referred to hanging out in parking
                            lots) and “browsing,” which is described as “a way of
                            interacting with the merchandise, as one contemplates a purchase, either
                            by looking at or testing the product” (<xref rid="ID730261c2-ad8a-4613-9a33-5ad34c3331fe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID84c9498c-589d-4fcd-b13d-1576b2c32eda">ibid., 58</xref>), Kato

                            associated with various parts of suburban commercial spaces in the US.
                            Based on the observations of these spatial and social practices, Kato

                        <p>The way Paul describes his early nightlife encounters at a very young age
                            is reminiscent of a test of courage, a form of claiming new space, or in
                            Northcote’s (<xref rid="ID0bf4effd-eb3a-497a-bc36-218d94cd860e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfdb13c2f-3d3a-4f41-aa97-4750ae0c2fb1">2006,
                                14</xref>) words again, a “self-made quasi [rite] of
                            passage.” Nightclubs seem like a space for the brave or the
                            “cool” to conquer. Such conquests mean leaving childhood
                            behind. </p>
                        <p>The relationship between identity performances and spaces becomes visible
                            in this interview passage where being young in a space for older people
                            is interpreted as “cool,” whereas if everyone is younger
                            than you, your “standard for being cool” changes. While he
                            remembers the older students calling him cool as he went out at a very
                            young age, he now finds these young kids “ridiculous” and as
                            lacking “self-control.” Coolness is related to
                            transgressions of age-based space restrictions. Therefore we can
                            understand expatriate teenagers’ nightlife practices as ways of
                            establishing and transforming age-identities; the nightclub provides the
                            space for such transformations. However, we can also see the performance
                            and affirmation of gender and group identities in these practices of
                            “being cool” through participating in nightlife.</p>

                            drinks</title>
                        <p>While “the girls” manifest their participation in nightlife
                            and hence their coolness through dressing up and dancing, “the
                            boys” often display their involvement in cool nightlife practices
                            by drinking and smoking cigarettes or marijuana. The girls meet before
                            going to the club, to get ready together by putting on make-up and
                            changing clothes. The boys, on the other hand, get ready by consuming
                            alcohol. Both practices are regularly documented by taking pictures and
                            can be seen as integral parts of the night out. These gendered practices
                            can also explain, at least partly, the two groups’ different
                            preferences of locations: the girls particularly enjoy going to upscale
                            clubs (where a dress code requires more extravagant attire) while the
                            boys prefer places like Mural (where the drinks are affordable). These
                            differences in practices often reinforce the gender divide that plays a
                            crucial role in the lives of the teenagers I met. After having
                            occasionally witnessed the reluctance of “the boys” to have
                            a night out with “the girls,” I ask sixteen-year-old
                            Bjorn—a mediator of sorts between the two groups—to
                            explain.</p>

                                        we can let ourselves go much more. You know, in Germany
                                        it’s not a problem. If you let yourself go and forty

                                        people watch, who don’t know that you do those things
                                        regularly, and it makes its rounds at school, because we are

                        <p>Bjorn is concerned with the issue of mutual surveillance, which he
                            attributes to “the girls.” He feels he and his male peers
                            can “let themselves go,” behave against expectations, if no
                            one observes—or later judges—them. While at first sight the
                            teenagers eagerly and flawlessly adapt to the common (adult) practices
                            in the club, their ways of forming their own nightlife routines and,
                            sometimes, ways of avoiding the expected “mature”
                            performance become visible after a closer look. The students, for
                            instance, like to go outside and sit on the stairs in front of the club.
                            The security team at the entrance never makes any objections when beer
                            is brought outside. Here, students engage in conversation more easily
                            and get some fresh air. “The boys” often seek the privacy of
                            a nearby back alley to smoke pot. This is perceived as a boys’
                            zone and “the girls” do not follow. I only witnessed
                            marijuana consumption among “the boys,” which “the
                            girls,” at the beginning of my fieldwork, found rather annoying.
                            During my last stay in June 2012, however, “the girls”
                            objected less and some of them had meanwhile tried smoking marijuana on
                            one or two occasions. However, consuming drugs is a highly gendered
                            activity. While both “the girls” and “the boys”
                            drink alcohol, none of “the girls” smoke cigarettes.
                            “The boys” usually purchase their drugs by contacting a
                            dealer via text message to then meet them at a nearby McDonalds.
                            Occasionally, “the boys” spontaneously buy marijuana at some
                            of the street barbecue stalls that are set up after dusk in the lively
                            areas of Shanghai.</p>

                        <title>Teaming up: nightlife as a peer group activity</title>
                        <p>“I flee to the teenage group; they are my protective herd
                            now,” I hastily write in my field diary sometime in the morning
                            hours after a night out at Mural. I describe my own reaction to a man
                            approaching me too closely on the dance floor. Feeling uncomfortable, I
                            simply leave the elevated dance floor, pass the crowded bar area, and
                            retreat to the teenagers who are sitting in their usual couch section.
                            It is one of those moments that are commonly described in ethnographic
                            writing as “eye-opening.” Although now almost a clichéd
                            and overly stylized aspect of the genre, such moments nevertheless
                            demonstrate how the ethnographer feels when achieving a new level of
                            insight. To me, this moment of dropping down on the couch next to the
                            teenage students is reminiscent of such accounts: all of a sudden, I
                            experience the peer group in a new way, as something protective. </p>
                        <p>Interested in the importance of the group for these teenagers’
                            nightlife practices, I discuss the issue with Bjorn during our interview
                            in June 2012. He shares that if one of his close friends and group
                            members cannot afford to go out, the group will usually renegotiate
                            their plans and meet at one of the boys’ homes, instead. Nightlife
                            activities can thus be seen as finding and displaying alliances and
                            friendships and as crucial for friendship and peer group development. As
                            noted earlier, those who do not partake regularly are in a more
                            difficult position at school and find it harder to become part of a
                            group. The peer group also forms a basis for interaction in class during
                            the week.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1024">163</xref> Establishing and
                            belonging to a social circle of friends is a process for youths all over
                            the world. However, in an environment of constant coming and going, the
                            task of finding friends who can communally experience the stay in
                            Shanghai can be difficult. Bjorn recalls the beginning of his time in
                            Shanghai almost two years earlier:</p>
                        <p>

                                <p>It was difficult to find out which friends suited me best. In the
                                    beginning, I was hanging out with entirely different people
                                    because they had taken me in first. And the friends whom I have
                                    now, the ones I’ve spent the last one and a half years
                                    with, weren’t even interested in the beginning. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1044">164</xref></p>
                            </speech>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bjorn’s comment shows how the teenage students constantly negotiate
                            their relations, trying to find friends that “suit them
                            best.” Nightlife plays a crucial role in this process. </p>
                        <p>The two peer groups I worked with, in addition to mutual interests and
                            being in the same classes at school, are mainly based on gender. These
                            gender divides are, on the one hand, strengthened by peer group
                            nightlife routines. On the other hand, nightlife offers opportunities
                            for the two groups and their classmates to casually interact. Sexual
                            interests can be articulated towards members of the other group while
                            the safety net of one’s own peer group remains intact.
                            Students’ first romantic and sexual encounters
                            emerge—although not solely—in these circles, as the
                            connection between the peer groups and their acquaintances offer a basis
                            for familiarity and trust. It is likely for this reason that several
                            couples formed within the two peer groups and their extended network
                            over the two years that I worked with them. </p>

                        <p>Approaching girls or boys outside the network is seen as positive, but I
                            rarely witnessed such interactions. Paul explains this pattern in an

                                    schools. Like, there is a social stigma behind dating girls of

                        <p>Paul’s comment on Chinese girls startled me for its derogatory
                            quality. However, it seemed to hint at the dynamics in the expatriate
                            community that I have come across during interviews with white
                            expatriate women in Shanghai in 2007—processes of
                            “othering” Chinese women as exotic, erotic, or
                            white-men-hunters. These expatriate women, mostly so-called
                            “trailing spouses,” whom I interviewed during my first
                            fieldwork among Shanghai’s expatriate community, perceived Chinese
                            women and their possible encounters with expatriate men (their husbands)
                            as threatening their marriage and lifestyle. Looking into these dynamics

                            relevance for teenage expatriate nightlife experiences and practices.
                            Although flirting and seeking their first romantic and sexual experience
                            are part of their nightlife practices, these behaviors mostly remain
                            within their social network, or at least within the network of
                            international school students, as Paul’s comment shows. Within
                            these networks, however, romantic relationships across ethnic and racial
                            divides are normal. The lack of flirting with “local”
                            Chinese in the clubs is most likely due to age, as “local”
                            teenagers are usually nowhere to be seen in clubs and bars. </p>

                            German school student Andrea makes a clear distinction between the
                            “Dorfkneipen” (country pubs) she knows from Germany and the
                            restaurants she enjoys frequenting in Shanghai.</p>

                        <p>After a few hours at Mural, usually when the open bar closes at 2 a.m.,
                            my young informants either enjoy the cab ride home or go to the next
                            location. Further clubs such as Dada (a university student location),
                            Shelter (Shanghai’s “underground” venue in an old bomb
                            shelter), Mint (a rather exclusive and expensive club at the top floor
                            of a high-rise building that maintains guest lists and strict dress
                            codes), Park 97 (an upscale location in the heart of the French

                            choices. The night out usually ends with a stop at McDonald’s on

                            practices2.4. </p>
                        <p>While the social aesthetics of Shanghai’s internationalized
                            nightclub scene prescribes a certain way of dressing, specific
                            practices, and financial means, the clubs do not enforce a minimum age
                            rule. Expatriate teenagers thus negotiate access to these spaces, which
                            would be off limits in most of their “home” countries, with
                            their parents alone. The students successively acquire certain routine
                            practices through regular club visits with their friends. While Farrer

                                and Field 2012</xref>) have convincingly argued that these nightlife
                            spaces in Shanghai serve as ethnosexual contact zones between locals and
                            expatriates, expatriate adolescents use Shanghai’s bars and clubs
                            primarily to manifest their age, gender, cosmopolitan, and urban
                            identities, as well as to strengthen their friendships. Furthermore,
                            nights out provide the counterpart to an otherwise structured school
                            life with its associated pressure. As Northcote (<xref rid="ID0bf4effd-eb3a-497a-bc36-218d94cd860e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID660f3c5b-cef5-4705-aa56-14a806ebf268">2006</xref>) suggests,
                            youths’ nightlife practices can be seen as small, self-made rites
                            of passage. In other words, nightlife offers a space for transformation
                            through repeat practices in a space that is also shared with adults.
                            These manifold transformations in nightlife spaces, however, are not
                            only concerned with being mature or entering adulthood, but also with
                            enjoying and preserving their youth. The communal process of claiming
                            youth and independence through partying is also accompanied by processes
                            of claiming urbanity (through choosing downtown nightlife locations) and
                            cosmopolitanism (through choosing to share a space with international
                            clubbers). Moreover, gender performances are brought to the fore and the
                            students’ first romantic and sexual encounters often take place
                            within this setting. Here, the network of the peer group provides a
                            sense of safety. Simultaneously, these friendships are strengthened
                            through the repetition of collective experiences. Like a stage offers
                            room for performance but also for (temporary) transformations,
                            Shanghai’s clubs provide a space for teenagers to practice and
                            explore these new narratives of the self. The meanings attributed to
                            nightlife practices are central to their involvement with the city. By
                            making weekends special and allowing them to claim new spaces for
                            themselves, both collectively and without their families, these routines
                            are a mechanism by which they adapt to the move to Shanghai.
                            Shanghai’s nightscapes therefore stage expatriate youth culture
                            and its emplacement in the city based on the participants’ own
                            agency. It is, in other words, primarily nightlife that helps teenagers
                            transform their enclaved experiences in the schools and compounds into
                            more desirable young urban identities.</p>

                <title>Chapter 3: The Shop: Hanging Out</title>
                <p>While the previous chapter provided one example of expatriate youths’
                    agency in creating their own routines and social spaces within Shanghai’s
                    global nightlife culture, this chapter examines another space and its related
                    practices: the shop.</p>
                <p>Students in grade ten or above at the German and French school campus are allowed
                    to leave the school premises during the school day. The older students make use
                    of this privilege during breaks or free periods and often have lunch outside.
                    Consequently, it is not surprising that a French café and a German bakery
                    are nearby, offering familiar flavors to the schools’ staff, students, and
                    their families. The students, however, are particularly attracted to a small
                    street in the vicinity of campus that hosts Chinese eateries and small shops
                    selling cheap dishes, snacks, and drinks.</p>
                <sec>
                    <title> 3.1. “The shop is our place to chill” </title>
                    <p>Here, in a narrow alley a five-minute walk from the school campus, students
                        can get cheap drinks, purchase a lunch of fried rice or noodles, or simply
                        hang out. The street differs from the surrounding gated communities and the
                        other cafés and bakeries that are located near the school. The small
                        alley is separated by a wall from the main street that runs parallel to it.
                        When entering the lane, students are suddenly welcomed by a different
                        atmosphere. Shabbier houses, makeshift stalls, new and broken pool tables,
                        laundry hanging out to dry, women cleaning vegetables, and smells of fried
                        food present a world entirely different from the school campus that was just
                        left around the corner. The students refer to this lane, along with all its
                        offerings and atmosphere, simply as “the shop” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24"> (Figure 24).</xref> </p>
                    <p>The shop has undoubtedly become part of the students’ everyday life.
                        Seventeen-year-old student Karina, for instance, explains her lunch break
                        routine during the last school year:</p>

                                it used to be. We went, I went there five times a week during lunch
                                break. I bought something to eat, for example gongbao or something
                                else</italic>. 
                                <italic>Karina refers to the traditional Chinese gong bao ji ding, a
                                chicken dish with peanuts, garlic, and chillies. It is incredibly
                                tasty and pretty cheap.
                                 But a huge portion. They really cook well.
                                Although, if you closely look at the environment, pretty shabby,
                                then you think, concerning hygiene, you rather don’t want to
                                eat there. But it is really good. At the shop most students buy
                                something to drink, bread rolls, sweets, chewing gum. It’s our
                                provider.</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1244">169</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1258">170</xref></p>

                        “chilling,” which teenagers adapted to German grammar as
                        “chillen,” refers to specific practices of “hanging
                        out” and seems to have spread among youths of various nationalities.

                                behaviour, like wandering, roaming or cycling around in the city,
                                physical activity games (football, teasing each other, etc.), or
                                even playing party games. Essential for “chilling” is

                                teenagers. Where such public spaces were available near the school,
                                teenagers stayed much longer after school. School environments
                                lacking such public domain or surrounded by traffic spaces, were

                    <p>The shop’s appeal as a hangout place is thus, first of all, connected
                        to its proximity to the school and the space it provides for recreation and
                        meeting friends during and immediately after school. At the same time, being
                        at the shop confirms the expatriate teenagers’ status as “older
                        students,” which they can express through taking advantage of the
                        privilege to leave campus during school time. The shop is therefore also an
                        age-specific experience that, unlike the school cafeteria and the
                        schoolyard, does not need to be shared with younger children.</p>

                    <p>While many students regularly eat out at foreign restaurants with their
                        families or friends (see Part III, Chapter 1), the food in the small alley
                        is, for many expatriate youths, the only local food they consume except for
                        dishes prepared at home by their ayi (see Part III, Chapter 2.2). Students
                        point out that the shop is obviously “more Chinese” than their
                        other everyday spaces such as the compounds or their schools. Here, some of
                        them have their only regular contact with locals, as sixteen-year-old Bjorn
                        explains.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>While it is true that the little street is frequented by Chinese locals, the
                        fact that the shopkeepers have responded to the desires of the foreign
                        students is immediately apparent: their inventory, for instance, includes
                        foreign candy such as imported Haribo gummy bears, which I had never seen in
                        any other small, Chinese-run shops in Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>The shop-owners have also set up pool tables in the street and put a small
                        stereo outside where students can plug in their mp3 players to play their
                        favorite songs. Furthermore, European students—as some of the
                        teenagers shared with me—have actively shaped the spaces themselves by
                        putting graffiti on the walls <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26"> (Figure 26a).</xref> </p>
                    <p>However, the local shopkeepers still use the spaces according to their own
                        needs. They often play pool themselves, use the tables to prepare food or
                        display wares for the local community, or hang their laundry to air-dry
                        outside <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26"> (Figure 26b).</xref> </p>
                    <p>The shop thus offers a venue for experiencing the locale. It is also,
                        according to the students, a place that is more in touch with the local
                        Chinese population than any of the other places they frequent. They share
                        the pool tables; they eat at the same restaurant. While the relations
                        between shop-owners and students clearly maintain the distance between
                        customer and service provider, the students, shop-owners, and their families
                        also share a common leisure space by playing pool, sitting outside, eating,
                        smoking, chatting, and relaxing together. The shop is no longer
                        “typically local” nor is it, as Antonia pointed out in the
                        interview, a well-groomed “expat” space; it sits in-between. </p>
                    <p>This in-betweenness also resonates with the students’ own entangled
                        claims of cultural identification and the process of gaining transcultural
                        perspectives (see Introduction). The shop as an in-between space invites its
                        actors to adopt a transcultural perspective with site-specific knowledge,
                        which I myself as a researcher had to acquire in the same manner as the
                        students. This phase of learning to navigate the area included, for
                        instance, becoming familiar enough with the menu of the little restaurant to
                        order their dishes in Chinese, knowing when and where to sit, or knowing how
                        much items cost in the small shop.</p>

                        economic and political power have the greatest opportunity to shape public
                        culture by controlling the building of the city’s public spaces in

                        finds that “public space is inherently democratic. The question of who
                        can occupy public space, and so define an image of the city, is
                        open-ended” (<xref rid="ID2a4128a5-c557-49f2-8db6-649158005aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdeb77cee-84c2-44e2-b5c7-24cd7e08a43e">ibid.</xref>). Zukin suggests, therefore, that public culture is</p>
                    <p>produced by the many social encounters that make up daily life in the
                        streets, shops, and parks—the spaces in which we experience public
                        life in cities. The right to be in these spaces, to use them in certain
                        ways, to invest them with a sense of our selves and our communities—to
                        claim them as ours and to be claimed in turn by them—make up a
                        constantly changing public culture (<xref rid="ID2a4128a5-c557-49f2-8db6-649158005aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4dadc411-cd71-4cd1-85ff-ba21a0ebad5a">ibid.</xref>). </p>
                    <p>Zukin’s understanding of public culture in the city as also
                        “socially constructed on the micro-level” (<xref rid="ID2a4128a5-c557-49f2-8db6-649158005aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID511a4092-82f5-478d-84fa-58fa586b4f0e">ibid.</xref>) highlights how
                        even small public spaces like the shop can be seen as part of
                        Shanghai’s larger public culture. </p>
                    <p>For the Chinese context, however, German geographer Dieter Hassenpflug (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc6692133-96f3-4c3b-8451-cae382720c1c">2009</xref>) suggests using
                        the term “open space” (offener Raum) instead of “public
                        space” to describe areas like the shop. He finds the notion of
                        “public space” ill-fitting for the situation in Chinese urban
                        politics because it relates to western norms of democracy, participation,
                        and civil society (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3e640a62-4b01-48a3-9ae6-6b8864bf64d9">ibid.,
                            32</xref>). He puts forward that the duality of “open” and
                        “closed” space is better suited for understanding the urban
                        environment in China (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf64e1786-9565-4759-9986-acf5e44331ca">ibid.</xref>). The “open space,” Hassenpflug suggests (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9db8ae01-538b-42b3-b1d7-b26672145110">ibid., 31</xref>), is
                        usually undefined space, and is opposed to the “closed,”
                        meaningful space; it is treated with little respect (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa9a8ba85-2b27-4686-b379-e0c16d357f54">ibid., 33</xref>) unless it
                        is claimed through rather “private” practices and rendered
                        meaningful (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID64190340-455c-4485-b158-c7a53ae569ad">ibid.,
                            31</xref>). Hassenpflug’s examples of how “open space”
                        is used and claimed are immediately familiar to every Shanghai visitor: the
                        laundry line on the sidewalk, people going for a stroll in their pajamas, or
                        people playing go—a Chinese game similar to chess. All these practices
                        fall within the realm of what might be considered the “private
                        space” in Western cities. It is with the understanding of such
                        “open space” that the Chinese shop-owners use the little alley
                        of the shop: there, they clean vegetables, dry laundry, and sit outside with
                        friends, neighbors, and family members. </p>
                    <p>The dualism of “closed” and “open” space is visible
                        in the expatriate teenagers’ spatial practices as well. Bjorn’s
                        mental map, for instance, highlights the students’ movements from one
                        “closed space” to the next <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27"> (Figure 27).</xref> </p>
                    <p>The locations displayed on this map are almost all closed and restrict entry
                        based on financial means (the nightclub, restaurant) or limit access to
                        those who already have a specific affiliation with the place (housing areas,
                        school). The only two “open spaces” that Bjorn placed on his map
                        of Shanghai are the People’s Square and the shop. Shanghai’s
                        central People’s Square, however, is less of a space to stay than a
                        place of transit, due to its many intersecting metro lines. Bjorn’s
                        use of arrows in his drawing also suggests the transitory role of the
                        square, as the arrow simply crosses through it, rather than pointing
                        directly at the unit. If we contextualize the experience of the shop in
                        these larger, everyday spatial experiences, the shop—despite its own
                        rules or access regulations prescribed by the school—appears as one of
                        the few “open spaces” the teenagers use. </p>

                    <p>I argue that it is this openness, and the fact that this liminal space
                        provides them with the freedom and flexibility to simply hang out, that
                        attracts the students most. Bjorn explains the usage of the shop by
                        comparing it to public spaces in Germany. In his comparison, however, he
                        chooses public spaces that—similar to Hassenpflug’s depiction of
                        “open space” in Chinese cities—can be claimed by hanging
                        out in them communally, by listening to music or drinking beer:</p>

                            <p> For me, the shop is somewhat like a park; or what a bus stop or a
                                playground is for youths in Germany. Practically speaking, that is
                                what the shop is. There are no problems with disturbances or breach
                                of the peace. […] You come here, bring your stuff along. Sit
                                down on the pool tables and drink. You listen to music. Everything
                                is allowed. It’s like a public place in my opinion, where
                                teenagers can just go.</p>

                    <p>The shop, in contrast to the guarded housing compounds as Bjorn suggests, is
                        an “open space” that, for him, stands for freedom and escape

                        understands these spaces as “the street,” a metaphor he
                        introduces to generally refer to ‘‘all outdoor spaces within the
                        public domain.” According to Matthews, the street “acts as a
                        liminal setting or a site of passage, a place which both makes possible and
                        signifies a means of transition through which some young people move away
                        from the restrictions of their childhood roots towards the independence of
                        adulthood” (<xref rid="ID972e8c05-9c7b-4972-9496-ba8d3a3235e6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe8f43312-26d1-4a86-bb0b-72bd1a1b3f3d">ibid.</xref>). </p>
                    <p>Matthews’ idea of streets adds another dimension to spaces like the
                        shop, that Hassenpflug’s helpful, albeit limiting division of open and
                        closed spaces does not address: the age-specific experience. For youths,
                        streets are places where, according to Matthews (<xref rid="ID972e8c05-9c7b-4972-9496-ba8d3a3235e6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID09aeec90-21d8-49d0-98af-472963afdf0c">2003, 106</xref>),
                        “adultist conventions and moralities about what it is to be a
                        child—that is, less-than-adult—can be put aside.” The
                        concept of streets therefore also highlights the liminal stage of youth in
                        society:</p>

                    <p>The students describe the shop as dirty and run-down, but chilled. They can
                        draw graffiti, listen to music, and play pool. It is a place more
                        organically grown than the carefully designed schools, compounds, and
                        nightclubs. Students do not do any homework or study there, but socialize in
                        a way that is less restricted than their interactions at school or in
                        nightclubs. It is the only space they visit during the week that is outside
                        the school and the expat compound. This little street—also

                    <p>The shop generally serves as an “open space” in Hassenpflug's
                            (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa32fc9fd-00a0-411f-826e-d2fc82b34d96">2009</xref>) definition, one
                        which the local Chinese residents and the expatriate students of the German
                        and French school campus nearby communally use and shape. For these youths
                        in particular, however, the shop can best be understood in Matthew’s
                            (<xref rid="ID972e8c05-9c7b-4972-9496-ba8d3a3235e6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb5ed1963-2517-44a6-854f-96e1eac0d13c">2003</xref>) terms as
                        “the street,” a site of passage where they need not follow
                        behavior conventions and can articulate their age-specific identities as
                        youths. Because the German students see this alley as a place to take a
                        break from school or hang out, the shop offers a feeling of freedom in
                        contrast to the rather sealed-off and surveilled spaces where they spend
                        most of their time. Whether and when students are allowed to go to the shop,
                        however, is still negotiated with the school authorities. At the same time,
                        through these negotiations, the shop confirms the students’
                        age-identities, namely the privilege of leaving campus during school hours.
                        The shop is a place for teenagers, not elementary school students, and can
                        be seen as a liminal space where one can still be young while moving away
                        from childhood roots, as Matthews’s (<xref rid="ID972e8c05-9c7b-4972-9496-ba8d3a3235e6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDed73ce81-92dd-47d8-b6e6-2d02b9452951">2003</xref>) understanding
                        of similar spaces highlights.</p>
                    <p>The German teenagers also describe the shop as one of the few spaces that
                        they share with Chinese locals (and one of the rare sites of interaction
                        with them). The owners of the small eateries and stores, viewing the little
                        street as “open space,” tolerate the students’ behaviors
                        of cycling, listening to music, or even spraying graffiti. The youths’
                        practices at the shop have developed from a tacit compromise with the
                        shop-owners, who see the teenagers’ presence as an opportunity to
                        enhance their business and subsequently provide pool tables, couches, snacks
                        the students know from home, and even a stereo where they can play their own
                        music. At the same time, the shop owners and residents themselves also
                        utilize the area as a leisure space. In this way, the shop is, in the
                        students’ words, “not expat,” and carries another
                        dimension of liminality or in-betweenness, thus fostering the development of
                        transcultural perspectives. The students’ practices are consequently
                        not only negotiated with the school nearby, but also with the shop-owners.
                        Nonetheless, the teenagers—despite their friendly conversation and
                        interactions with them—also remain customers. The concluding chapter
                        of this part therefore focuses on the emplacement processes of expatriate
                        youths in Shanghai and further examines the students’ relations to
                        Shanghai’s “local” citizens.</p>

                <p>As the previous chapters have demonstrated, exploring, experiencing, and

                    the same time, Shanghai—despite being an international
                    metropolis—has been described by other scholars as exclusive in the
                    literal sense. To be regarded as “Shanghainese,” for instance, is an
                    almost unobtainable status even for migrants from other parts of China, as
                    sinologist Sonja Schoon’s (<xref rid="IDf3138a0f-1e36-416c-8246-32eeb4504ce9" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6ea1496f-47f4-4178-a74e-6fc511b8d1ac">2007</xref>) work on the

                        <p>The very criteria for being identified as Shanghainese are vague, in view
                            of the fact that neither by birth or language, yet definite

                <p>Donald and Gammack suggest a general atmosphere of Shanghai, a “sense of
                    self” that “operates according to principles of exclusion.” In
                    the chapters of the previous part, “Arriving,” I have shown that
                    many of the places teenage expatriates routinely frequent, such as schools and
                    housing areas, are secluded and not even considered part of the city by the
                    students themselves (see Part II, Chapter 1, on managing Shanghai by dividing it
                    into “the city” and familiar spaces). Students and their families
                    draw strong boundaries around their expatriate circles and their contact with
                    local Chinese is very limited. Consequently, Shanghai’s citizens have
                    remained rather absent in my accounts tracing the youths’ everyday
                    practices. However, the question arises if this absence is only due to the
                    boundaries expatriates create as a means of making distinctions and finding
                    comfort and community. What role, if any, do the “principles of
                    exclusion” Donald and Gammack attribute to Shanghai play in the lack of
                    interaction between expatriate and Chinese youths? </p>

                            those of “staying put” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3dc5e214-aff8-4959-9ef0-4702bfaba988">ibid. 1996,

                <p>Brah’s term “diaspora space” aims to conceptualize the
                    entanglement of the experiences of “migrants” and
                    “locals.” Applying her analytical concept to my work allows me to
                    focus on the relations between the two heterogeneous groups, expatriates and
                    “those who are constructed and represented as indigenous” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="IDed334e54-cf6e-42f7-8c0d-5bb8e989ec20">ibid.</xref>). To that end, this
                    chapter investigates this “diaspora space” by exploring the
                    relationships between expatriate teenagers and China or Chinese citizens, to
                    further understand the boundaries I have observed and described throughout this
                    ethnography. It also highlights how the students perceive their (lack of)
                    interaction with Chinese citizens and how they position themselves within the
                    greater context of Shanghai and China.</p>
                <p>Since “diaspora space” as an abstract theoretical concept was
                    ill-suited for the interview discussions, I simply asked students if they felt
                    accepted in China. The teenagers reflected on their relationship to Chinese
                    society, at which point I brought the term “integration” into the
                    discussion. It became obvious that, for many of the students, the term
                    “integration” had never been used in relation to their situations,
                    but remained something they saw as reserved for less privileged migrants in
                    Europe or elsewhere. Based on these new reflections on integration, and by
                    tracing their views on the role of the expatriate community and what expatriate
                    status means for them, this chapter investigates the relationship these youths
                    felt they had with Shanghai itself (4.1). It then draws attention to a topic
                    that emerged during interviews—the teenagers’ experiences of
                    “not fitting in,” of being visibly foreign in the city (4.2).
                    Subsequently, to shed further light on the “diaspora space,” I
                    examine the barriers to integration that the students perceived, as well as the
                    difficulty they had making connections with Chinese youths (4.3). Finally, this
                    chapter explores students’ subjective views of the attitude of Chinese
                    authorities toward foreigners (4.4) and shows how integration and feelings of
                    being accepted in China, according to these students’ experiences, can
                    only go so far as being welcomed as “a guest” (4.5).</p>

                    <p>Part III, Chapter 3 of this ethnography identifies the international schools
                        as hubs in Shanghai’s expatriate network and explores practices and
                        values that foster the sense of an expatriate community. These
                        “inner” definitions are tied to the way in which expatriates
                        consider themselves to be separate from China, which becomes visible when
                        discussing the idea of “integration” with students. </p>
                    <p>During an interview at an Element Fresh—a restaurant chain favored by
                        expatriates— in a downtown shopping mall in Xuijiahui,
                        seventeen-year-old Giovanni from the German school explains:</p>

                            <p><italic> In a sense you are integrated. But you actually don’t need
                                the others. You can move around quite independently. And that is why
                                you actually only need the taxi drivers.</italic>

                    <p>Giovanni’s description of being able to remain independent from local
                        Chinese or, “the others,” in his words, seems based on a clear
                        sense of a divide between “us” and “them.” His
                        opinion likely derives from the observation that relationships across this
                        divide usually center merely around service or business, and not around
                        casual encounters or friendships as his usage of “need”
                        suggests. Giovanni’s statement also startles me, as he does not seem
                        at all curious about meeting any Chinese people. When I inquire further
                        about the process of integration, he comments: </p>

                                home, in your home or apartment, you are actually totally different
                                again. […] And when you are out with other foreigners,
                                somewhere, like on Hongmeilu, then you don’t adapt to China,
                                either.</italic>

                    <p>While Giovanni acknowledges a little bit of “adapting,” he sees
                        most of the daily routine—whether at home or eating out with
                        friends—as “totally different.” Like Giovanni, American
                        school student Paul describes the expatriates in Shanghai as forming a
                        circle of their own. </p>

                            <italic> where my school is at, it’s a, like, really
                                international community. There are very few Chinese people that live
                                around there. So everyone just stays in that bubble. They don't have
                                to experience China if they don’t want to. They just kinda
                                stay in that group.</italic></p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Both Paul’s description of the “bubble,” which I discuss in
                        the Introduction, and Giovanni’s comments on not needing “the
                        others” illustrate how, in their experience, the expatriate community
                        functions (to a large extent) independently of Chinese society. This image
                        of an autonomous community is based on maintaining a unifying and comforting
                        experience for its members, but is simultaneously linked to establishing
                        strong boundaries towards Shanghai’s other citizens. </p>
                    <p>When Giovanni and I further discuss his occasional interactions with local
                        Chinese, I ask him to assess the Chinese perceptions of foreigners. He
                        answers by describing a situation he has just experienced on his way to the
                        interview:</p>

                    <p>Giovanni’s use of“outside” to describe his interactions
                        with Shanghai’s citizens, while sitting in a restaurant highly
                        frequented by expatriates, underlines his perception of a strong local-expat
                        divide. Furthermore, Giovanni addresses his experience of being treated with
                        respect because he is so obviously a foreigner. </p>
                    <p>This treatment, along with the inherent demarcation of the expatriate

                                that. I also like it here. But it is not that I have many Chinese
                                contacts. Nor do my parents have many Chinese contacts. Erm. I think
                                we always have this special status. I always find that the foreigner
                                in China has a very different status. [...] I wouldn’t say
                                that the Chinese law applies in the same way to us.</italic>

                    <p>Andrea, like Paul, uses the metaphor of the “bubble” to describe
                        the expatriate experience in Shanghai. Furthermore, she stresses that
                        foreigners in China have, in her words, “this special” and
                        “very different status.” Andrea, familiar with expat postings
                        elsewhere, considers this foreigner status not only as “special”
                        in comparison to that of the local Chinese, but also to expatriates
                        elsewhere:</p>

                                from expats in Singapore, or in Spain or somewhere; the foreigners,
                                the German expats. Because here it is still, here it is still very
                                different. Here, you still have a driver, here you also don’t
                                have to learn the language. I don’t know, but if you as a
                                German go to Mexico, and you work there, you have to learn Spanish.
                                I think, in my opinion. And when I go to Singapore, then it is not
                                like that either. […] If you are lucky, you get a car, I
                                think. That’s what I heard, from friends, but not everyone
                                gets one. It is much more expensive.</italic>

                    <p>In Andrea’s view, the status of expatriates in Shanghai is different
                        from that of expatriates elsewhere due to the financial benefits and clear
                       difference between the average local income and that of expats. Andrea
                        argues that this status has an influence on the relationships between
                        foreigners and local Chinese: expats do not even have to learn Chinese. </p>

                        between foreigners and locals. She also identifies the different financial
                        means as a dividing experience and points out that expatriates might be
                        welcome mainly due to their high spending power. Although she criticizes
                        expatriates’ attitudes towards China as well as what other students
                        present as a “special status,” she can also relate to the
                        experience of such a status. She argues that, in her experience, the Chinese
                        always treat her as a foreigner in the sense that she is something special,
                        and that this treatment inevitably hinders friendships:</p>

                                really respect the country. They feel they can get away with things
                                they would never do in Germany. Because they think they have a

                                In Germany, if you are a foreigner, it is not necessarily regarded
                                as positive. And here it is like that. They get excited about
                                foreigners— “Oh, foreigners!” and so on—and
                                are happy about it and, sometimes, even get special treatment or

                        “locals” view him in contrast to his white friends, who are
                        immediately identifiable as foreigners:</p>

                    <p>In summary, expatriate students feel they have a “special status in
                        Shanghai” and are often treated differently from Chinese citizens.
                        Some of the students’ descriptions can even be labeled as cases of
                        positive discrimination. This is particularly true for those who are
                        identifiable as foreign at first sight. Many of the students echo
                        Don’s above account of the Chinese citizens’
                        “respect” for foreigners, and for white people in particular.
                        The next section further explores the role of the expatriate students’
                        physical differences from or similarities to the Chinese, and how either
                        affects their experience in Shanghai. While it further elaborates upon the
                        privileged status of whiteness, it also examines the white high school
                        students’ experiences of “not fitting in,” as well as the
                        constant gaze of the “other.”</p>

                        experience” (Fechter 2007b, 60). Consequently, for many expatriate
                        students, the difference between their bodies and those of the
                        Chinese—namely their “whiteness”—plays a crucial
                        role. Whiteness has recently come into focus among scholars, who explore the
                        cultural construction of whiteness and challenge it as an unexamined and
                        unmarked category (Hill <xref rid="IDfafb9322-943e-4c03-a98b-efcaac9bab69" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3ece09a-85f0-43fe-a349-931fc701271b">1997</xref>). Whiteness as examined in these studies, is summarized by
                        Donald (2000, 157) who in turn draws on Richard Dyer’s White ([<xref rid="ID9cd09a43-5064-4d17-a108-b73e9dfcab58" ref-type="bibr" id="ID601c6b98-8fe5-4255-b528-2097e75f2e6f">1997</xref>] 2008), as
                        “a racial category; generally understood as a construction of
                        privilege in many political, social, and economic environments.”
                        Whiteness is not only seen as a bodily difference in regard to skin color,
                        but the perceived difference also includes height, overall stature, hair
                        texture, or eye shape. “White” therefore does not stand for skin
                        color alone, but for an intricate web of aspects, as Dyer highlights:</p>

                        diary from 2007, when I had commented more frequently on being the object of
                        the gaze than during my stays between 2010 and 2012, my own desire to be
                        able to blend in, to not be immediately visible as a “stranger”
                        is apparent. This experience relates to Stephanie Donald’s point that
                        we are unaware of our white ethnicity due to the perceived normality and
                        status it often brings along: “The bearers of whiteness so often
                        pretend to neutrality. We refuse our ethnicity, while playing on its
                        potential for advantage in the main streams of money, power and political
                        clout” (<xref rid="IDd569cf98-215d-4502-b501-9a5a7c1cbe79" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa5e1769a-a08c-4f9d-93ad-3df63cdbc990">Donald 2000,

                    <p>This becoming visible as “white,” which I often found disturbing,
                        can be understood in the context of Richard Dyer’s argument, that
                        “Whites must be seen to be white, yet whiteness as race resides in
                        invisible properties and whiteness as power is maintained by being unseen.
                        To be seen as white is to have one’s corporeality registered, yet true
                        whiteness resides in the non-corporeal” (Dyer [<xref rid="ID9cd09a43-5064-4d17-a108-b73e9dfcab58" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa749849b-a6a5-4a0c-9c2a-a5835fcdb263">1997</xref>] 2008, 45).</p>
                    <p>Dyer’s description of losing power through being registered as white
                        and becoming aware of one’s corporeality explains my and the
                        teenagers’ feeling unsettled by the locals’ stares. In a manner
                        similar to my early experiences, Britta, who is Norwegian, describes how it
                        can be difficult to deal with not blending in:</p>

                    <p>In addition to the sudden awareness of corporeality, my ethnographic material
                        on expatriate women gathered in 2007, and an article by Willis and Yeoh

                        British migrants, provide evidence that white women experience feelings of
                        unattractiveness in China. According to Willis and Yeoh, the phrase
                        “Bridget Jones in China” was commonly reported to be a term by
                        which women referred to themselves. Some, for example, reported Chinese
                        people commenting on their “fat arms” (Willis and Yeoh <xref rid="IDbe4a551b-352b-4f59-8f66-fb66fe0453bc" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1b2aed34-7302-4a7a-8f64-a8b1d588e824">2008</xref>). As Katie Walsh

                        expatriate women in Dubai, increased physical activity—such as taking
                        fitness courses on the compound—and beauty treatments such as
                        manicures, pedicures, and facials are also very common among adult white
                        women in Shanghai. The adult female interviewees I worked with in 2007 also
                        reported feeling large and ungainly when talking about the difficulties they
                        had finding clothes that fit. </p>
                    <p>While some of my female teenage informants share this experience,
                        they—in contrast to the adult women—do not seem to feel that
                        their attractiveness is questioned. Nevertheless, buying clothes in China
                        heightens their experience of “being different” and literally
                        not fitting in:</p>

                    <p>These experiences of physical difference play an important role in the
                        migration process. Evidently, these white youths’ experiences of
                        Shanghai are significantly affected by the stares and other reactions they
                        receive from Shanghai’s Chinese citizens. To some extent, such
                        reactions may, by highlighting the importance of whiteness, reaffirm the
                        impact white skin still has. However, the stares can also be unsetteling and
                        thus curb the power usually attributed to whiteness; their physical
                        difference becomes a state which the teenage expats cannot escape, because
                        blending in is impossible. A thorough discussion of the intricate issue of
                        race and racism in Shanghai, however, is beyond the scope of this study and
                        would require research on and input from the Chinese perspective. In my
                        fieldwork, however, I focused on the subjective experiences among expatriate
                        youths and merely aim to point out how their physical appearance influences
                        their practices in Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>The students’ discomfort at constantly being seen as different and
                        their suddenly hightened awareness of their skin color might be a
                        significant reason why they seek out spaces they claim as
                        “expatriate,” which, in turn, leads to further boundary drawing.
                        Eighteen-year-old Peter, for example, explains how he feels exhausted and
                        estranged in the urban environment due not just to the language barrier, but
                        to the impossibility of blending in:</p>

                                the problem is also that I haven’t mastered the language at
                                all. And I don’t like that. First of all, everyone looks at
                                you. That might be normal. You look different from them and many

                    <p>Peter’s remark that “life is very exhausting here” stands
                        in stark contrast to the comfort of expatriate life that students usually
                        describe. However, Peter’s account delineates expatriate life from
                        what lies outside the “bubble” and, at the same time, points to
                        the factors that contribute to its creation and maintenance, as well as the
                        expats’ withdrawal into it. Britta also explains her encounter with
                        this phenomenon:</p>

                            <p> Also it is nice when you go to places where you see other western
                                people. Like, you don't feel like the only one who is blond in the
                                whole building. You can, like, look around and see, maybe they are
                                American or German.</p>

                    <p>The experience of being white therefore clearly shapes the ways expatriates
                        create and define spaces for themselves. The physical walls that protect the
                        gated communities or international schools and the boundaries around the
                        body—namely, cultural constructions of whiteness—often support
                        each other. Fechter has identified similar experiences among expatriates in
                        Indonesia (<xref rid="ID0bbd646f-0e84-4833-a4f4-421f9698f34e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9e73cdf0-9f0d-402f-a573-23ea6e7c9602">2007b,

                                In particular, many expatriates feel rather uncomfortable being
                                looked at by Indonesians, and their wish to avoid this “gaze
                                of the Other” therefore informs many of their spatial
                                practices (<xref rid="ID0bbd646f-0e84-4833-a4f4-421f9698f34e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa7f8c487-f0c4-4529-9d96-fb235c9e9d7b">ibid., 67</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Thus not only their own view of the city, but also the process of being
                        viewed, shapes the ways expatriates respond to these urban landscapes and
                        might be one of their many motives behind avoiding certain spaces—such
                        as the subway—and embracing others, such as nightclubs or bars.</p>
                    <p>Fechter and Walsh (<xref rid="ID427226e9-a67f-464d-ae76-8f2ab7441a1f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID860354f3-149f-472b-92ad-93cc03bb51da">2010,

                        of “western” for white “may be true in both the
                        imaginations of expatriates and those they come into contact with.”
                        However, while expatriates are usually imagined as “western” and
                        “white”—these terms are often used
                        interchangeably—not all expatriates fit into these catergories. Many
                        expatriates in Shanghai are not “western” at all and may come
                        from other parts of Asia (as was the case for the majority of the students
                        at the Singaporean school I visited). Furthermore, a considerable number of
                        the expatriate students who consider themselves “western,” such
                        as those who come from Germany, are not white. While I only interviewed one
                        black girl at the Singaporean school and did not accompany any black
                        expatriate students in Shanghai, I met many students of Asian descent who
                        had a Chinese parent or grandparents who had migrated to Europe or North
                        America from Hong Kong, Mainland China, or other parts of Asia decades
                        before the student’s family relocated to Shanghai. These children form
                        a large percentage of the students at all of the international schools and
                        their experiences in Shanghai differ substantially from those of their peers
                        who are perceived as “white.” </p>

                        that their ability to blend in is positive. French school student Arnaud,

                    <p>Although the ways students experience physical differences encourages them to
                        seek out spaces frequented by foreigners, the accounts of the self-ascribed
                        “Chinese looking” expatriates demonstrate that this aspect alone
                        is inadequate for explaining the local-expat divide. To further investigate
                        this “diaspora space,” the entangled relations between
                        expatriates and Shanghai’s citizens, I return to the expatriate
                        students’ contemplations on other barriers which prevent them from
                        forming balanced relationships with local youths.</p>

                    <p>In <xref rid="IDecea7aef-3ce2-4829-a87f-c5875646859b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID450ce6cf-1c77-467c-9a60-f7b7a2738ec7">1969</xref>, in his
                        influential edited volume Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, Fredrik Barth
                            ([<xref rid="IDecea7aef-3ce2-4829-a87f-c5875646859b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID282a66b2-224e-4a14-b5f9-29deff03536f">1969</xref>] 1998) proposed
                        that boundaries and barriers between groups are worth close examination
                        because it is “the ethnic boundary that defines the group, not the
                        cultural stuff that it encloses” (Barth [<xref rid="IDecea7aef-3ce2-4829-a87f-c5875646859b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID38db51fe-9eb2-405a-814b-4fe14f7f1175">1969</xref>] 1998, 15).
                        While this might seem like an overemphasis on the role of barriers, I
                        believe that perceptions and practices surrounding boundary drawing should
                        be investigated not least because this is a focus that has also been
                        promoted in the realm of transcultural studies. As I have put forth in the
                        Introduction, constant negotiation between creating boundaries and crossing
                        them takes place in culturally-entangled environments. To explore new
                        surroundings and unknown practices does not necessarily erase but may even
                        provoke the desire to create distinct spaces of familiarity. Therefore,
                        drawing on both Nadig (2004) and Pütz (2004), and their ideas of
                        transculturality in progress and as practice, I highlighted the relevance of
                        the processes and practices of drawing cultural boundaries to our
                        understanding of transcultural relations. Consequently, this subchapter
                        explores the students’ articulations and perceptions of boundaries
                        within the “diaspora space” that hinder encounters between
                        expatriate and “local” youths. </p>
                    <p>When I introduce the term “integration” during several
                        interviews, it promptly triggers contemplation about what
                        “integration” might mean, and students often aim to apply the
                        idea to their own social worlds in Shanghai. At the same time, these
                        discussions implicitly show how the youths perceive such borders, as
                        seventeen-year-old Karina’s definition of “integration”
                        demonstrates:</p>

                                country, China for instance. Then I would integrate, in the sense
                                that I, for example, just learn the language. Or I should maybe also
                                study their culture. That I adapt myself a little to them. Not only
                                do my own thing, my own culture, so to say, again. That I maybe show
                                interest in their culture. That I start trying Chinese food. That I
                                behave like a Chinese. &lt;L&gt; That I tune to the same wavelength,
                                so to say. I believe the language is very important.</italic>

                    <p>Karina defined “integration” by applying it to her own situation
                        in China and seeing it as the efforts she should make, such as learning the
                        language and becoming familiar with Chinese culture, food, and behavioral
                        practices. Taking up the four perceived barriers that Karina
                        names—language, culture, food, and behavior—this section
                        illustrates how expatriate youths experience these categories as areas for
                        potential insight.</p>
                    <p>All the international schools currently offer Chinese language courses and
                        the majority of students try learning Chinese at some point during their
                        stay in Shanghai. While some students keep studying Chinese, many find it
                        too challenging and abandon their efforts. Some students who have a native
                        Chinese parent already have language proficiency, but the differences in
                        dialect can make it difficult even for them to understand Shanghainese
                        citizens. Furthermore, all of the parents of Chinese descent have a good
                        command of the language spoken at their children’s school. Charlie,
                        for example, describes how her parents occasionally talk to her and her
                        sister in Chinese, but that the two usually answer in German. Don, who
                        speaks a Chinese dialect with his parents, judges his Chinese as “not
                        so good” and considers learning Chinese extremely difficult for
                        foreigners in general:</p>

                            <p><italic>And I also believe that foreigners, as such, that they cannot
                                really achieve it, to learn Chinese. Well, I myself had problems. In
                                the beginning, I really studied a lot, Chinese. Nothing stays.
                                It’s really—you have to study every day. Every day. And
                                no foreigner here at the school does that.</italic>

                    <p>While many of the students at the German school actually enroll in the
                        Chinese language classes the school offers as part of their curriculum, the
                        time most students spend studying, as Don points out, is not sufficient to
                        achieve a good conversational level or the ability to read Chinese
                        characters adequately. Then again, other students who are proficient in
                        Chinese demonstrate that language skills—though helpful—do not
                        necessarily enable friendships across the local-expat divide.</p>

                                Chinese friends. When I think about it, that isn’t normal,
                                usually, living in a foreign country and not knowing the people in
                                that country. […] It is even stranger if you, for instance,
                                take [student’s name]. He has been living in Shanghai for
                                eleven years now. In China. And doesn’t know a word, hardly
                                any Chinese. He could live here perfectly for eleven years without
                                speaking Chinese. That shows how little we are integrated. You
                                don’t have to know Chinese. We are a group of our own where
                                you get by with German. Actually, I should talk to Chinese people

                        students, very low because they can manage their daily lives successfully
                        without having any Chinese language skills. Antonia’s lack of Chinese
                        friends, on the other hand, cannot be attributed to an inability to
                        communicate. As she sees it, making friends with Chinese locals would
                        require more effort on her part. </p>

                        Norwegian student Britta’s description of her initial encounters with
                        a Chinese family touches upon this issue as well, showing how this cultural
                        barrier can be understood as consisting of unknown practices, for instance
                        eating habits.</p>

                                and you don't have to figure out the stuff. […] In the
                                beginning, we were with this Chinese family, and they just took us
                                to these really hardcore Chinese food places and we are like, how

                    <p>Britta apparently experiences the need to “figure out the stuff”
                        in order to cross the local-expat divide as stressful, uncomfortable, and
                        perhaps even frightening. She thus actively seeks out the company of, in her
                        words, “international friends.” These statements illustrate that
                        the international high school students actively participate in the
                        boundary-drawing of the expatriate communities. However, Britta’s
                        quote also shows that the demarcation gives expatriate teenagers, who
                        constantly move, a sense of continuity through finding “similar things
                        to home.” The tentative exploration of Shanghai’s environment,
                        coping with the emotional strain of moving, and integration into the
                        expatriate community are among the many experiences expatriate teenagers are
                        forced to contend with (See Parts II and III.)</p>

                                notes every time, that there is a difference. And that they mostly
                                have no time because of school. Because they always have to study.
                                And that they think differently. It’s a little

                    <p>Charlie thinks that the separation of international and Chinese schools and
                        the extremely time-consuming Chinese schooling renders friendships to local
                        Chinese students difficult for her. Based on her friend’s accounts,
                        she also assumes that they “think differently.” </p>
                    <p>While the statements above, which I related to the four barriers stemming
                        from Karina’s interpretation of “integration,” mostly
                        revolve around differences, some students also reflect upon the lack of
                        opportunities—and effort made—to get to know Chinese youths. </p>

                            <p><italic> But I had a Chinese friend. The daughter of my mom’s
                                friend. We were always close friends. And then, in fifth or sixth
                                grade, her school got really tough. And then we couldn’t see
                                each other anymore. And since then we are hardly in touch anymore.
                                That is a little difficult with the people here, because they have
                                so much school. But still, when we go out for example, I like to
                                talk to the Chinese. They are mostly university students, because
                                then they have time to party. And then I feel accepted. But I still
                                feel like a foreigner at the same time. Because they see me as a

                    <p>Antonia’s statement again reveals the differences in school systems as
                        a key factor in impeding friendships with “local” students. She
                        also points out that, the older students are, the greater this divide
                        becomes. My own observations confirm that (especially for teenagers) there
                        is very little overlap in the everyday spaces of expatriate and Chinese
                        youths. Additionally, even those spaces that are less
                        demarcated—namely, nightlife spaces (Part IV, Chapter 2) and the shop
                        (Part IV, Chapter 3)—present few possibilities for meeting Chinese
                        students their age. </p>
                    <p>In addition to drawing (spatial) barriers to create comfort zones, language
                        difficulties, differences in practices surrounding food and education, and
                        the lack of places to meet Chinese youths, some expatriate teenagers also
                        perceive the Chinese state and its citizens as active agents in keeping
                        foreigners “foreign.”</p>

                        foreigners</title>
                    <p>Some students also voiced a feeling that China, or Shanghai’s citizens,
                        reject or limit non-Chinese people from being part of their society. In this
                        section, and keeping the expatriates’ practices of demarcation in
                        mind, I present three teenage girls’ perceptions of exclusion. Two
                        perspectives, those of white girls Andrea and Karina, convey their feelings
                        on the local-expat divide, as well as the state’s policies and its
                        treatment of foreigners. The third perspective is that of Antonia, whose
                        parents are German and Chinese. She reflects on her status in Chinese
                        society and describes how Chinese people constantly ascribe the status of
                        “foreigner” to her. It shows that her idea of urban citizenship,
                        her claim to be Shanghainese as a way of taking a transcultural perspective
                        (as I discussed in Part I, Chapter 4.1) can be difficult to pursue. </p>
                    <p>Sixteen-year-old Andrea, who moved with her family to a Chinese complex

                            <p> On an emotional level, I’d say that we are not really, well,
                                we are not a part of it. […] The Chinese also call us
                                foreigners. That’s what we are. I don’t think we will
                                ever, I don’t know. Well, I don’t have the feeling that
                                they allow us in entirely. We have our special [status], we are
                                treated differently. I notice.  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2099">201</xref></p>

                    <p>Andrea ties this emotional perception of being an outsider to questions of

                            <p> The state doesn’t permit it. I don’t think I would be
                                allowed to attend a Chinese school. With my views, politically. I
                                think I wouldn’t be allowed to. That’s why. That might
                                actually be an example of us not being integrated.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2113">202</xref></p>

                    <p>While Andrea’s assumption is not entirely true, research by Anna
                        Greenspan (Greenspan 2008a; 2008b; 2011b; 2011a) demonstrates the extreme
                        difficulties expatriates face when choosing local schools. Greenspan’s
                        research comments on the differences between Chinese and
                        “Western” education, a debate that gained prominence not only in
                        the USA, but also in Germany, after the publication of Amy Chua’s
                        Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother (<xref rid="IDe71b12c8-341b-43ac-a216-5da5c4ee4419" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1edff385-5941-4a01-b138-c40287bcebf8">2011</xref>). In her blogs
                        and writings, Greenspan discusses cases of western families who chose the
                        Chinese education system for their children. Investigating parents’
                        and children’s challenges in adjusting to the different school system,
                        Greenspan shows that enrollment at local schools in Shanghai is possible,
                        but only if parents and children possess the necessary language skills and
                        persistence. One mother interviewed by Greenspan describes the difficulties
                        her family experienced when attempting to enroll her children in a Chinese
                        school: </p>

                        local Chinese school become apparent in Greenspan’s interviews. During
                        a joint talk with James Farrer at a workshop organized by Heidelberg
                        University’s Cluster of Excellence: “Asia and Europe in a Global

                        <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2157">206</xref> Greenspan discussed the cases
                        of a few parents and children who chose this option. She found that teachers
                        continuously ascribed “foreign” status to foreign children, i.e.
                        using them to shame other students who performed worse in class than the
                        foreigners did. Many western parents, Greenspan argued, also felt uneasy
                        about the political education their children received, which conflicted too
                        strongly with their own values.</p>

                                “It is your fault.” And then, of course, the police were

                    <p>While other students feel that Chinese law does not apply to them—as we
                        saw, they find buying drugs easy and the police not at all
                        intimidating—Karina clearly fears the Chinese judicial system. Her
                        account of the police also differs from Charlie’s account of her
                        father’s preferential treatment due to his German passport.
                        Experiences, therefore, differ greatly. Karina’s family is originally
                        from the Czech Republic, where her relatives experienced the Prague Spring,
                        in 1968. Her family’s memories of this era, which they likely
                        communicated to Karina, undoubtedly contribute to her fear of arbitrary
                        state power and her perception of the Chinese state as being hostile toward
                        foreigners.</p>

                        Shanghainese, has a different view on China that focuses less on the role of
                        the state and more upon the diversity of its citizens:</p>

                                Germany, foreigners come, then normally many of them stay, as does
                                the next generation, and so on. And then they should integrate
                                themselves. Start speaking German and so on. But here, the
                                foreigners learn Chinese to be able to communicate a bit. But they
                                will always stay foreigners. They don’t integrate. And this is
                                due to them leaving again soon. And because here you simply get by
                                being a foreigner. Probably, even precisely because you are German.

                        narratives, emphasizes her distance from “typical expats.”

                        narratives of emplaced foreigners, such as Antonia and her family, who have
                        been living in Shanghai for more than five years. His interviewees differed
                        from expatriates who were only in Shanghai for a temporary assignment, as
                        they had made a conscious decision to stay there. Farrer (<xref rid="ID358cfeee-fafd-442c-bb8d-0ad5df07d667" ref-type="bibr" id="ID96119bfc-a877-4a7e-bd01-a4fe8cb4b540">ibid., 2</xref>) argues that
                        the different narratives of these long-term settlers serve as “claims
                        to cosmopolitan urban citizenship in the emerging global city.” He
                        explains: </p>

                            <p>These narrative typologies show that Western expatriate narratives of
                                emplacement cannot be reduced to a single postcolonial temporality,
                                though postcolonial imaginaries remain a useful expression of
                                simultaneous belonging and dislocation in the twenty-first-century
                                Asian global city. Long-term foreign settlers mix narratives that
                                situate them in multiple temporalities—postcolonial,
                                post-socialist and post-modern—each implying a different
                                fragile possibility of urban citizenship. Reduced to their
                                sociological content these stories are symbolic claims to urban
                                citizenship: a claim of cultural citizenship (as “Old Shanghai
                                hands” or “New Shanghailanders”), a claim of
                                social citizenship (as witness to history and local residents), and
                                a claim of economic citizenship (as “players” in
                                Shanghai’s global economy). Woven altogether—as they
                                sometimes are—they form an ideal of a culturally cosmopolitan,
                                locally integrated and economically contributing global/urban
                                citizen, conveniently eliding the nation-state. Few settlers
                                actually live up to this nearly impossible ideal, and thus these
                                narratives of emplacement often serve as claims to relative virtue
                                or entitlement in comparisons with other “foreigners.”

                    <p>Like Farrer’s informants’ “claims to relative virtue or
                        entitlement,” Antonia’s claims to being Shanghainese should be
                        seen as distinct among her expatriate classmates. At the same time, Antonia,
                        like Farrer’s informants, has a high ideal of being a
                        “culturally cosmopolitan, locally integrated” citizen.
                        Antonia’s reflections show how it is difficult to “live up to
                        this nearly impossible ideal.” As the child of a mixed marriage who
                        even speaks Chinese, she describes how she still feels she will never fit

                    <p>She further explains how Chinese society’s refusal to accept her as
                        Shanghainese leads her to doubt her Shanghainese identity and claims to
                        “Chineseness.” To be regarded as “Shanghainese,”
                        however, is also an impossible status for migrants from other parts of
                        China, as briefly discussed at the beginning of this chapter. Consequently,
                        while Antonia would otherwise consider herself Shanghainese, she feels like
                        a foreigner because she believes she is seen as one. I have elaborated on
                        her identity performances in Part I, but her descriptions are also
                        interesting in the context of Shanghainese-expat relations. She notes:</p>

                    <title>4.5. Concluding thoughts on the local-expat youth divide in Shanghai </title>
                    <p>When aiming to be part of Shanghai’s cosmopolitan image, expatriate
                        teenagers often turn to the city’s spaces that are frequented by both
                        foreigners and locals, as Chapter 2 of this part (on nightlife) illustrates.
                        Further, the young expatriates explore and claim open spaces outside the
                        traditional, glamorous image of the metropolis—such as the
                        shop—to simply hang out with their friends. Their engagement with the
                        city through such places serves an important function by helping them find a
                        sense of emplacement, and to regain the agency they might have been missing
                        after moving, which is always initiated by their parents. In order to foster
                        a sense of continuity, community, and social standing, and to create
                        comfortable ways of life (see Part III), however, the expatriates draw
                        boundaries between themselves and Shanghai’s “locals.” The
                        experience of emplacement and locality is thus, at the same time, tied to
                        expatriate practices that attempt, to a certain extent, to exclude
                        “China” from their everyday spaces—for example at the
                        international schools, gated communities, Western restaurants, and imported
                        food stores that expatriates frequent.</p>
                    <p>Focusing on the “diaspora space,” a “point at which
                        boundaries of inclusion and exclusion, of belonging and otherness, of
                        ‘us’ and ‘them’, are contested” (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID85fd8ae1-3948-493e-ad9c-c912c3df504b">Brah 1996,
                            208–209</xref>) and by discussing students’ ideas about
                        “integration” in Shanghai, this chapter shows that transgressing
                        or even dissolving the strong local-expat divide is generally difficult for
                        expatriate teenagers. None of the students I accompanied during their
                        everyday routines have local friends. These youths often see their
                        expatriate community as self-sufficient or even “autonomous.”
                        Students feel that interacting with or even befriending Chinese people is
                        difficult because they are considered different for being white. Most
                        students gain this awareness of bodily differences, of being consciously
                        white, suddenly and unprepared and they experience it as unsettling. As a
                        consequence, they often seek out places with large numbers of other white
                        people. The teenagers are also intimidated by language and cultural
                        barriers. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, expatriate youths who were in frequent contact with Chinese
                        children when they were younger experience Chinese teenagers as being too
                        involved with their schoolwork and having no time for friendships or
                        activities outside of school. Therefore, neither the Chinese and expat
                        students’ schools nor their leisure spaces coincide. The strong
                        local-expat divide is therefore also related to a lack of concrete meeting
                        places, a lack which is interpreted by some students as the Chinese
                        government’s way of keeping Chinese and foreign youths apart. Chinese
                        passport holders are prohibited by the Shanghai municipal government from
                        enrolling in international schools, and Chinese local schools are not an
                        option—or at least a very difficult one—for foreign students, as
                        the accounts by Greenspan (<xref rid="ID35b7ad63-35f2-4d90-8746-d06aacd886f5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID67d4f467-efda-4d69-8a06-3ddbeaac6f9c">2008a</xref>; <xref rid="IDa0c4c0ab-99dd-4a5e-9a66-4240ea1cb212" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6005bb2c-0984-42be-9150-055e8de4a968">2008b</xref>; <xref rid="IDf97e7077-99a6-4752-b49f-e9acb2b7d6ca" ref-type="bibr" id="IDed5abe79-d8f5-4b1c-bd9b-bc2470d6fd73">2011b</xref>; <xref rid="ID417380bb-6483-4192-bdf7-5cc45a2cb1d2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc64b9b51-5261-4b57-a4dd-737f0fd74d02">2011a</xref>) above show.
                        Expatriate teenagers consequently perceive the Chinese state as either
                        intimidating or as not pertinent to them, emphasizing their different, even
                        “special” status as foreign passport holders. Furthermore, the
                        expatriate teenagers that attempt to cross such perceptions and borders feel
                        that the Chinese youths regard them as “exotic” and that Chinese
                        society only accepts them as “guests.” </p>
                    <p>This lack of interaction with Chinese youths demonstrates that the most
                        influential part of the move to Shanghai, for some students, might not
                        necessarily be exploring or learning about the new cultural environment or
                        specific cultural practices in Shanghai, but rather their general experience
                        of “difference” and the emotional challenges associated with
                        being uprooted. In the words of ethnographer Ghassan Hage (<xref rid="ID18a9d278-f726-4659-b7e3-1da223092356" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3a838495-46ac-4147-beb5-8cefd322047c">2005</xref>), who studied
                        Lebanese communities in different national settings, “one should also
                        be careful not to think that just because we feel we are crossing
                        international borders, the change from one national culture to another is
                        the most signiﬁcant aspect of our move” (Hage <xref rid="ID18a9d278-f726-4659-b7e3-1da223092356" ref-type="bibr" id="ID047d8331-b6fb-414e-8531-b2b887d4d58d">2005</xref>, 470).</p>
                    <p>Hage’s words bring us back to the idea of transcultural perspectives
                        that I described in the Introduction, to the students’ own reflections
                        on the various aspects and consequences of moving abroad. As described in
                        Part I, Chapter 4, when tracing four students’ different transcultural
                        perspectives and identity positionings, this chapter shows in more detail
                        how the experience of difference and attempts to overcome (as well as
                        efforts to draw and maintain) boundaries are central to expatriate
                        students’ daily lives. The distinctions expatriate youths make towards
                        “local” society and the apparent lack of opportunity to meet (as
                        well as their meager interest in meeting) Shanghainese youths, originate in
                        the transitory nature of their stay in Shanghai—an aspect of the
                        expatriate lifestyle that is highlighted throughout this ethnography. The
                        international students are all aware that the moment of moving on will come.
                        For the youths I worked with at the German school, this moment coincides
                        with graduation, an event that I discuss in all its elements of celebration
                        and farewell—and the corresponding need to make decisions about the
                        future that it places on all students—in the final part of this
                        ethnography, “Moving On.”</p>

      <p>The final part of this ethnography, “Moving On,” returns to the expatriate
        youths’ experience of Shanghai as a transient space. The first chapter centers on the
        students from the German school and analyzes their ways of managing the imminent move away
        from Shanghai. It focuses on their graduation and its related festivities as a means to say
        goodbye to Shanghai and examines their plans, anticipations, and anxieties regarding their
        next stop: university. The second chapter concludes this work by revisiting the German
        students two years after they have left Shanghai and returned to Germany, focusing on their
        new beginnings there. It presents the students’ perspectives and reflections on
        transnational mobility and explores how their experience of “returning” is
        linked to the overall findings of this ethnography. </p>

                focused on and that you rely on. And you have gotten this routine. And you have to
                rebuild all this again. Because every human being needs some kind of routine, I

                in a hotel and I don’t have my things, and I don’t have my things
                anywhere else &lt;L&gt;              that means that, right now, I’m in the middle of
                nowhere.

        </p>
        <p>After days of packing, Peter describes his situation as being “in the middle of
          nowhere.” Peter’s belongings are now in a container that will be shipped to
          Germany, and he and his family have moved into a hotel, where they will stay for the
          remainder of their time in Shanghai. Prior to moving out of his family’s home,
          Peter’s room probably looked similar to that of Mia <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30"> (Figure 30)</xref> when she prepared
          for her move to Germany. Interestingly, she sent this image to me paired with a picture of
          her room as it looked when she lived in it <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11"> (see Figure 11, in Part III, Chapter 2.2)</xref> as a
          response to my question of what “home” (in Shanghai) meant to her. Evidently,
          for Mia, home meant both her room in Shanghai and the routine of packing and leaving it
          behind. This transitory experience is shared by all students featured in this ethnography.
          Their complex notion of home, as illustrated by Mia’s pictures, has been succinctly
          conceptualized by Sara Ahmed, Claudia Castañeda, Anne-Marie Fortier, and Mimi
          Scheller’s (<xref rid="IDa1af01c3-ebc3-4b7f-8c0d-b0edeb29f719" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3cf5abab-1020-4cd1-b10e-b6ccf793625d">2003</xref>) idea of
          “uprootings/regroundings,” which allows one to consider home and migration to
          be not mutually exclusive. I have already discussed the issue of home-making or
          “regrounding” in Part III, Chapter 2, and throughout this ethnography, but
          this final chapter is concerned with the other, concomitant aspect,
          “uprooting,” and how the students experienced the move away from Shanghai.</p>
        <p>For the majority of expatriate youths, graduation from school coincides with leaving
          China. While some of the teenagers’ families stay in Shanghai, others only wait for
          their children to complete school before moving on. Consequently, for some students, even
          their place of return—the family home—shifts and, as a result, will make
          future visits to Shanghai impossible or difficult. Therefore, in comparison to youths
          whose parents remain in a more or less stable location, graduation is also a closing
          ceremony for, as Olivia from Belgium puts it, the “Shanghai-chapter” of their
          lives.</p>
        <p>I returned to Shanghai for two weeks in May and June of 2012, to observe the students
          from the German school during this period of change. It was also my final visit to
          Shanghai, and thus my own farewell: to the city, to my friends, and to “my
          field,” which was slowly dissolving since the majority of the actors that inform my
          study were about to move on. During this very intense fortnight, the students and I bonded
          over the common theme of saying goodbye and having to face the question “What
          next?”</p>
        <p>The morning after my arrival in Shanghai, I visit the German school to find some of the
          students gathered for their final oral exams. They are nervously going through their
          notes, rehearsing topics with each other, explaining matters that might somehow be related
          to their exam topics, and trying to calm each other down at the same time. This cycle
          repeats itself the following day, when the other half of the students sit their exams. I
          am happy to see all of them again and to catch up on the latest news, especially on their
          plans for the coming days: exams, the announcement of the final results, parties, dinners,
          club visits, the commencement ceremony and festivities, the much-anticipated graduation
          ball, the ball’s after-party, and a farewell barbecue at “the shop.” We
          go on final shopping tours at the fabric and glass markets and simply hang out at the
          students’ homes. In-between observing and occasionally participating in these joyful
          events, I meet ten students for individual, hour-long follow-up interviews to discuss
          their future plans, the decision-making process that led to moving away, their feelings
          about leaving Shanghai and finishing school, as well as their anticipation and any anxiety
          they have about entering university. These matters are presented in detail in the
          following three subsections.</p>

          <title>1.1. Leaving Shanghai</title>
          <p>Andrea and I are sitting outside, on the narrow pavement in front of the same café
            where we met for our first interview, just around the corner from her parents’
            apartment. It is our third interview and, by now, she knows the procedure. The street
            noise level occasionally requires us to shout at each other, but we enjoy our ginger
            lemon tea nonetheless. We start talking about the stressful exam period, the
            celebrations surrounding graduation, and her plans for the summer and beyond. When I
            inquire how she feels about leaving Shanghai, it is apparent that she is still sorting
            out her thoughts and emotions about moving.</p>

            possibly for good. </p>
          <p>Mia expresses similar feelings about saying goodbye to Shangahi when she and I meet to
            discuss her upcoming departure. We sit on her bed, drinking water, in contemplative
            silence—quite unlike the street noise in the background during my conversation
            with Andrea. Eventually Mia formulates her feelings:</p>

              <p><italic>[Leaving feels] strange. […] I’ve spent most of my life in Shanghai.
                […] I was away now and then and so on, but I’ve been here for six years in
              total, and everywhere else I’ve only spent two or three years. And that’s
              why this is really my home. It is … Here, I know my way around best, I know
              the people; the people know me. Here, even though I only speak a little Chinese, I
              manage. […] Yes, when I walk through the city, I know where I am, I know how to
              get where I want to go. […] Even if you’ve been here for a long time, it
              never gets boring. […] And sure, on the one hand, I’m also looking
              [forward to new things.] On the other hand, nevertheless, I could stay. I
              wouldn’t have a problem with that. […] Actually, I don’t want to
              leave.</italic>

          <p>Mia has mixed feelings about the imminent changes. Leaving Shanghai means leaving the
            familiar behind. For Andrea and Mia, there will be no family home in Shanghai to return
            to during university breaks, nor for Olivia, who summarizes her sentiments about leaving
            in an interview at the French café close to her school:</p>
          <p>

              <speaker>Olivia</speaker>
              <p><italic>Well, the school in Shanghai is the one I went to the longest, ever.
              That’s why I find it hard. Because I have so many memories, especially because
              I’ve spent my youth here. That’s what you always like to remember. Yes,
              good friends, first love, bla bla bla—all that existed. Yes, I will have a lot
              of memories here. And it is difficult to suddenly … I mean, I can’t
                decide upon leaving now, I have to [leave]. My dad has to move because of work.
                That’s why I don’t really have a choice. And, well, the farewell is
                difficult for me.</italic>

          </p>
          <p>Interestingly, even after graduation, Olivia feels she has no choice of staying on in
            Shanghai and decides to move to Belgium with her family. Some students’ families,
            such as Antonia’s, Xia’s, Bjorn’s, Charlie’s, and Kressi’s
            will stay in Shanghai. For some students, as in Giovanni’s case, one parent will
            stay for work and the other will return “home” with the younger siblings,
            but for the students whose families are about to leave Shanghai altogether, graduation
            is not only a goodbye to their peers and the school, but also to their house and the
            city. The possibility of returning for visits is therefore rather uncertain.</p>

          <title>1.2. Celebrating twice: graduation and goodbyes</title>
          <p>The students expend many resources and efforts on shaping their final weeks in Shanghai
            and their final days at school. Graduation, for them, involves preparing several events
            and memorabilia. The major event is the graduation ball, which the students
            traditionally organize themselves. Preparations include finding ways to fund the event,
            choosing and renting a suitable venue, organizing a caterer and decorations, and
            creating the program for the evening. Furthermore, the class is busy writing, designing,
            and getting their “Abibuch” (a special graduation yearbook) printed, as well
            as preparing an after-party, which will take place at another downtown location, after
            the formal ball. The 31 students estimate that they spend about RMB 300,000
            (€33,000) on these celebrations. Part of this sizable amount comes from ticket
            sales for the ball, which cost RMB 400 (€44) each, yearbooks, which cost RMB 100
            (€11) each, and fundraising activities, such as bake sales, that took place at the
            school during the last term. Several foreign companies also sponsored the event for a
            sum amounting to around RMB 160,000 (€17,600). The celebratory events like the
            ball will take place in addition to the official commencement ceremony that is organized
            by and will be held at the school. The students shape this event to some extent, too,
            since they contribute a few musical performances and a student speech. </p>
          <p>The importance of this official ceremony, which values students’ achievements and
            celebrates their graduation, becomes apparent in Mia’s anticipation a few days
            prior to the event:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="speech361">
              <speaker> Mia</speaker>
              <p><italic>I am really looking forward to it. I am sure it will be really beautiful. I
              think I will be really sad. When you just notice that, well, school is over now.
              Really! If you think back... It is the only thing you remember! The time before school
              [...] well, I personally don’t recall that anymore. And even if you were in
                pre-school before and in Kindergarten before that, you had something every day. And
                the time before that—you really can’t remember! That’s why. Really
                strange, I think. Really weird.</italic>

            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Mia ponders the school routine, and the significance of losing something that has
            accompanied her throughout her life. The end of this period is met with anticipation and
            joy, as well as sadness. However, it is not only the end of school, but also the end of
            their time in Shanghai that the expatriate community celebrates with these ritual
            festivities.</p>
          <p>Graduation ceremonies are rites of passage which, for the students in Shanghai, are
            part of a larger farewell ceremony. According to ethnographer Arnold van Gennep ([<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe635178d-5b7b-431a-8568-c89b38b9ccde">1960</xref>] 1992, 11), who introduced the
            notion of important, life-changing rituals as “rites of passage” with the
            general aim of insuring a “change of condition or a passage from one
            magico-religious or secular group to another,” such processes undergo three
            different phases: the preliminal or separation phase, the liminal or transitional phase,
            and the postliminal or incorporation phase. Van Gennep, however, noted that not all
            rituals consist of all phases and that it is impossible to “achieve as rigid a
            classification as the botanists have” (ibid.). </p>
          <p>The commencement ceremony that I attended at the German school can be seen as an
            essential element of the first part of these rites of passage—the separation
            phase, as well as of a process of the students’ change in status from high school
            to university student, and an opening to the transitional phase—a phase that is
            celebrated after the graduation ceremony at the graduation dance and the students’
            after-party. Because the commencement ceremony was undertaken in a routine way that
            I—and seemingly everyone else attending—was familiar with and had
            anticipated, I will not fully analyze that ritual here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e209">220</xref> Neither will I focus on a
        theoretical discussion of the graduation ball or the after-party. Instead, in the passages
        which follow, I will illustrate the overall mood of the festivities I attended, as well as
        the thoughts of the students and the school community they are a part of, to further
        underline the challenges, emotions, and possibilities this moment of leaving Shanghai holds
        for expatriate youths. Nevertheless, Van Gennep’s notion of the rites of passage helps us to understand
            the importance of such festivities in guiding students’ transition from high
            school to university, and from Shanghai to elsewhere. </p>
          <sec>
            <title>The commencement ceremony</title>
            <p>It is the day of commencement and I am sitting next to Bjorn’s brother and the
              rest of his family. The soon-to-be graduates are seated in neat rows of chairs on both
              sides of a stage. They are attired for the occasion: the girls in dresses, the boys in
              suits. Equipped with a camera and my field notebook, I wait among the parents,
              siblings, and students’ friends, for the event to start. We all read the small
              program, which helpers from the school have distributed on the long rows of mats that
              have been used to convert the steps in the piazza into seats. The evening begins with
              music and a welcome by the school principal. A small group of students from the
              elementary school leads us through the evening; their announcements repeatedly amuse
              the audience. The school’s musical stars, various prize winners, play and sing
              between the different speeches. The German consul general talks about the high level
              of the exams, about the opportunities and challenges of being an expat, and cites the
              current federal president of Germany, Joachim Gauck, who calls for commitment to
              society. A representative for the German industry and commerce in Shanghai follows
              with a humorous but also political speech and—probably with an eye on his
              preceding speaker—thanks the German ministry of foreign affairs, hereby
              stressing the importance of their financial support, which is always contested. The
              two head teachers of the graduating class give a speech that evokes much laughter and
              is accompanied by photos of all the students on class outings. </p>
            <p>Then, after a musical intermission, the school principal gives his full speech before
              the diplomas are handed out. Starting with political explanations and concerns about
              changes and lessened interest from the German government in financing German schools
              abroad, the principal appeals to parents and German companies to make their needs of
              this support heard. After this political digression, he announces the average grades
              and is proud of the results that are, as he emphasizes, above the German average. He
              then recounts various school events (trips, arts, and sporting events) to stress how
              important it is to be involved in such social activities, in addition to earning good
              grades. Finally, he cites Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who, according to him, said that
              “parents should give roots and wings to children” (Wurzeln und Flügel
              soll man den Kindern mitgeben). He elaborates on the relations students have to
              different places and how many will move to Germany, Switzerland, or wherever their
              roots are. However, he declares “one part of your roots is also our
              school” (aber ein Teil eurer Wurzeln ist auch unsere Schule), naming a few
              students who have been in Shanghai since kindergarten. He then turns to the second
              part of Goethe’s suggestion for educating children—the wings:</p>
            <p>
              <disp-quote id="dispquote67">
                <p>Your wings are—not only because of all the miles that you have already
                  travelled up in the air—much stronger and more flexible than those of your
              future classmates at university. They will carry you. You will realize: you, as the
              graduates of a German school abroad […], are special. This should not be a
              reason to become arrogant—and you aren’t. Public-spirited, cool, and nice
              young people exist everywhere. You will nonetheless attract attention. Because the
              experiences one brings along, the things you know and are familiar with, stick to you
              like a second skin. And something else is sticking to you that is different to most
              other youths—namely, a certain familiarity with the world, a familiarity with
              things that are different and foreign to others. Due to your experiences in the world,
              you are in some respects more independent, flexible, and open and therefore you will
              see and grasp more opportunities. However, others also have special expectations of
              you. I am sure—we are sure—you will be able to meet these. We are sure you
              will fly.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2263">221</xref>
                </p>
              </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>This sentiment, which I have tried to reconstruct here from my frenetically-scribbled
              notes, marks the end of the principal’s speech and is met with enthusiastic
              applause. Interestingly, it mirrors the narrative of privilege and pressure that I
              came across in students’ descriptions of international schooling that was
              highlighted in Part III, Chapter 3.4.</p>
            <p>After the school principal’s speech—marking the separation phase of the
              ritual (Van Gennep [<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3f941d0d-f17e-4287-8157-ded8e19cb70e">1960</xref>] 1992)—the diplomas
              are handed out to all the students in alphabetical order. Applause greets the students
              when their names are called and as they step out onto the stage, receiving handshakes,
              diplomas, gifts, and a photo. After the diplomas are distributed, a few parents gather
              on stage to sing a song (not as perfectly as their children) and, finally, three
              female students—Mia and Antonia among them—give the last speech of the
              evening.</p>
            <p>The three girls first start recalling their last years as students. In a humorous
              way, they describe conflicts and debates, as well as positive memories. One after the
              other, their classmates step onto the stage, according to their arrival time in
              Shanghai, to create a timeline which ranges from kindergarten until 2010, only two
              years prior. After sharing these memories, the students’ speech culminates in
              thanking parents, teachers, siblings, the school principal, and the technician
              responsible that evening. “We are all only here because of our parents and, at
              this point, we want to say thank you for that.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e237">222</xref> This line is met
          with laughter, applause, and cheers from the audience, which consists primarily of family
          members. This response in particular shows how important this statement is for many
          parents. Their children’s
              acknowledgment of the beneficial aspects of their experience in Shanghai may alleviate
              any remaining feelings of anger or guilt that the move initially prompted (see Part
              II). As they continue with their speech, the graduates combine a farewell to their
              high school days with a farewell to Shanghai. Contemplating the uncertainties of the
              future and the difficulties of choosing a career path, they end on a cheerful note,
              which is followed by much applause: “But one thing we do understand: Namely,
              what we have to celebrate. To have been a student yesterday, to be almost an adult
              tomorrow, but especially that today we are young.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e243">223</xref>
            </p>
            <p>This last line of the girls’ address can be seen as a transition into what Van
              Gennep ([<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4e7bcfd5-7b77-4db0-a7fe-f3ac4d1a6d87">1960</xref>]1992) conceptualized as the
              second phase of a rite of passage—the liminal or transition phase. Victor
              Turner, who continued developing and illustrating Van Gennep’s notion of
              liminality in rite-of-passage processes, describes the liminal phase as a condition
              where people “slip through the network of classification” and are
              “betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom,
              convention, and ceremonial” ([<xref rid="ID81f216d9-059a-4ee6-8d1b-7481f199c287" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e91d05e-e88d-435c-a379-bbe31b5d3e63">1969</xref>]2008, 95).
              Likewise, as the speech given by the three girls indicates, being young is understood
              as both being free from the obligations of high school as well as of those of
              adulthood. “Young” here means celebrating without having greater
              responsibilities. The last line is a call for the start of these celebrations, now
              that the youths have their diplomas in hand. Based on Van Gennep’s ([<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa1aa87d4-905b-4f28-8a09-e1659d3996b5">1960</xref>]1992) and Victor
              Turner’s ([<xref rid="ID81f216d9-059a-4ee6-8d1b-7481f199c287" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf65c6a08-4050-4165-b3f5-bd5deb93e029">1969</xref>]2008) understanding of
              liminality in the ritual process, social anthropologist Allan Sande (2002) describes
              this phase of partying among recent graduates in Norway as a phase that allows youths
              to behave in ways that are against the cultural norm and that break moral rules.
              Sande, who particularly illustrates the role of alcohol and intoxication in Norwegian
              graduation celebrations, suggests that the youths become detached from society during
              that time, to then be ascribed adult status once this liminal phase is over. </p>
            <p>Following the graduation ceremony, a dinner is hosted for everyone at the school.
              After eating at the buffet and conversing with parents, taking photos, and receiving
              congratulations, the students leave for Mural. This is the first unofficial party that
              everyone joins, but it is also a time for reminiscing and bidding farewell to their
              favorite party location. Siblings and friends who used to live in Shanghai and, like
              me, came from Germany to be part of the celebrations, join in. Parents and teachers
              are not part of this club visit. However, they participate to an extent in the
              graduation ball and after party that take place the following day.</p>

            <title>The graduation ball and after-party</title>
            <p>The next day, I meet some of “the girls” at noon at a hairdresser located
              in the same compound where Olivia lives. Olivia, Charlie, and Mia have appointments to
              get their hair done for the graduation ball. I take photos and watch them get styled.
              Back at Olivia’s house, the three girls and I put on make-up and slip into our
              dresses. Mascara and eye shadow are passed around as we all get excited about the
              upcoming evening. Olivia’s parents are also there and are very supportive. In
              the late afternoon, their driver takes us to the event location on the South Bund. We
              have to get there early, because the students have one more practice for a dance
              choreography they will be performing that evening. I watch them rehearse, scribble a
              few notes in my diary, and take photos. By now, I am shivering in my evening dress, in
              the freezer-like, empty, air-conditioned hall. I am glad to see the first guests
              arrive; we gather upstairs in the rooftop bar for our first drink of the evening.
              Here, the temperature of an early-summer evening in Shanghai feels comfortable and the
              breathtaking view of the Pudong skyline and the passing ships on the Bund leaves
              everyone in awe <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31"> (Figure 31).</xref></p>
            <p>Everyone, including me, takes pictures of the well-dressed people, the sunset, and
              the view; there is also a professional photographer, whom the students hired for the
              night. The setting clearly distinguishes the event from graduation balls in Germany.
              While the latter mostly take place in gymnasiums or auditoriums, the chosen location
              in Shanghai is a former warehouse that has been converted to a very high standard.
              Many guests congratulate the students for their great choice of this venue right by
              the docks that combines a marvelous view with simple elegance. Eventually, the guests
              move inside and are seated at large round tables according to a seating order the
              students have discussed for months. I join a table with some older siblings, friends,
              and former students of the school. The graduates all sit at a long table in the center
              of the hall. The evening features a buffet dinner, several talks, the students’
              dance, and a few pranks and games, including a high-heel-shoe running contest with the
              teachers. The graduates also show a home-made movie that features them talking about
              their classmates and their future plans, as well as saying thank you. I mingle and
              take photos <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32"> (Figure 32).</xref> </p>
            <p>Around midnight, the students get ready to leave the location and invite everyone to
              move to the after-party location: a lounge bar in the heart of Shanghai’s former
              French concession that the graduates rented for the occasion. The tickets for the
              graduation ball come with a lace band wrapped around them, indicating each
              guest’s table number in Chinese characters. Later, if you wear the band around
              your wrist at the after-party, all drinks at the bar are free. Only the students,
              their friends and siblings, and several teachers come along. Parents are nowhere to be
              seen.</p>
            <p>Now, intoxication and partying, which Sande (<xref rid="IDf6016142-6243-4a5d-b445-cdea20f8f827" ref-type="bibr" id="ID959f621e-c3a4-4715-91fb-8f657c784cbc">2002</xref>) describes as important
              parts of this rite of passage, are in full swing. Drinking and dancing with (now
              former) teachers creates a generally euphoric atmosphere as old barriers are torn
              down. The girls have all changed out of their long evening gowns and into short
              cocktail dresses; many pairs of high heels have been replaced by ballet flats. I busy
              myself with taking pictures and, after a while, students begin to ask me to take
              photos of them with their friends. I am happy to replace the photographer who has left
              by now, but also use the time to chat with various students. As the evening wears on,
              more and more students are found outside, in a small alley behind the club, sitting on
              the ground, talking to their friends, and enjoying the last of “their”
              night.</p>

          <title>1.3. Moving on: anticipation and anxieties</title>
          <p>During my final visit to Shanghai, the students and I bonded over the shared feeling of
            an unknown future and the difficulty of choosing a career path. Mia’s description
            of her struggle to make such a choice illustrates feelings expressed by the majority of
            the students I talked to:</p>

            <speech id="speech362">
              <speaker>Mia</speaker>
              <p>That was already a topic a year ago: “And what are your plans after
                graduation?” “Hmm.” That is so … At least I always had
                an answer, but it has changed a lot during the last year […].</p>

                shouldn’t mind, but there were always two possible answers. Some always said:
                “Oh, great!” and the others always said: “Hmm. Well, you can’t
              really earn a lot with that” or something similar. It was not necessarily about
              money, but simply like, you just can’t really … So many people do
              that. Well, there were always these kinds of reactions and somehow that made me think
              again. And then, one day, I was sitting, well, that was during Chinese New Year
              holidays, just before the written exams … I was sitting downstairs with my
              mother and we were talking and then I said, “Yes, actually I could also do
              something else.” On a sheet of paper on the table I wrote down everything that I
              find interesting. There were ten different things on it, some actually going into very
              different directions. […] And then I thought, okay, I can take a look again at
              what I want to do. There are so many opportunities […]. Shouldn’t
              underestimate that. And that’s why I am still looking and then I will
              apply.</italic>

          <p>Trying to find a path into the future, Mia weighs her interests, the opinions of
            friends and parents, and future job opportunities as well as possible income. Many
            scholarly explanations for youths’ career choices and their employment histories
            have shifted their focus “towards poststructuralist accounts in which
            individuals’ choices and their ability to judge and negotiate risk are seen as
            important in shaping their biographies” (<xref rid="ID951fc9af-c593-41c8-9b3a-ccf6fee76d83" ref-type="bibr" id="ID185425bb-ca42-4390-9135-d1a11b30b984">Valentine 2003, 41</xref>). Despite this
            individualization, social networks as “product[s] of specific social and physical
            environments,” still play a major role in “providing information about
            employment opportunities […] and in developing social and cultural capital”
              (<xref rid="ID951fc9af-c593-41c8-9b3a-ccf6fee76d83" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb1ae4502-ee9d-4dfb-bdb9-924b096239c6">ibid.</xref>). As Mia’s account
            demonstrates, this influence of the social network on career choices can also be
            observed among expatriate teenagers in Shanghai. For many of the students, the choice of
            a university program also goes along with the decision to relocate. Some set their
            priorities according to the likelihood of being accepted at a specific university, while
            others chose a location that appeals to them and then consider the different options for
            studying there. Olivia, for instance, wants to move back to her parents’ home town
            in Belgium.</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="speech365">
              <speaker>Olivia</speaker>
              <p><italic>I’ve been abroad for some time now. And my parents have always hinted at,
              pointed out that they would like it if I came with them to Belgium to study there. And

              [their city]. Well, I still know a few people in Belgium. They are all going to [study
              there] as well, so I will also see them again there. And the girls, my friends from
              Shanghai, […] they also study close to where I will go. So I will get to know
              Belgium a little. Because, I mean, I was very young when I left Belgium. […] I
              would like to get to know Belgium a little, well, Europe in general. And that’s

          <p>Olivia’s quote not only reveals her parents’ influence on her choice of
            university location, but also her own desire to reconnect with her past, her broader
            family, and her national culture and mother tongue. It is these manifold desires and
            influences that the students must now negotiate when leaving Shanghai and choosing their
            next step—and stop—in their lives. Based on their ethnographic work with
            young people in Finland, Elina Lahelma and Tuula Gordon (<xref rid="ID6d1b346c-8d10-451c-9419-67d52455d272" ref-type="bibr" id="ID422c35cf-e1a7-428b-b5e3-da506079e6f8">2003, 381</xref>) argue that “moving
            away from home is full of ambivalence for young people. Most of them talk about it with
            terms of hopes, but also with terms of fear.” Although “home” is a
            flexible, rhizomatic nework of locations, practices, and ideas for most expatriate
            youths in my study (see Part III, Chapter 2), this is true for them as well.
            Furthermore, for the students in Shanghai, moving away from their family home often
            coincides with this home no longer existing. The following sections therefore highlight
            their specific fears and hopes.</p>
          <sec>
            <title>The challenge of everyday practicalities</title>
            <p>Many of the students I interviewed grew up with housekeeping staff at home and
              parents who demanded that their children focus on school rather than concerning
              themselves with the chores and demands of a household. Consequently, a few of the
              young people’s accounts reflect a fear that their future homes will lack the
              necessary equipment for preparing food or doing laundry, or that they themselves lack
              the skills to handle those tasks. Additionally, the students are nervous about
              unfamiliar lifestyles, such as student life in Germany. Peter, for instance, uses our
              interview to bombard me with questions about living in a shared flat with other
              students in Germany.</p>

                <p><italic>I am in touch with other people who graduated last year or the year prior from
                  our school. Mostly Chinese people. Chinese connection. And one girl told me that
                  after half a year she was homesick for China. She found that, in China, people are
                  much more open than in Germany. And the other said she was homesick for Chinese
                  vegetables. In Germany there is only salad. In China there are so many different
                  varieties of vegetables.</italic>

            <p>While many freshmen will experience similar concerns (whether they have had the
              advantage of an ayi or not), Xia’s fear is compounded by the knowledge that he
              will also lack access to the necessary incredients to prepare his favorite foods. In
              other words, Xia’s concerns about not being able to take care of himself in
              Germany are not limited to household practicalities, but also to simply feeling
              comfortable there. For expatriate youths, anxiety about moving on—or, in some
              cases, moving “back”—parallels larger anxieties about missing
              familiar things and the fear of not being able to fit in.</p>

              introduction and Part III, Chapter 2. Simultaneously, Charlie’s anxiety about
              not fitting in is also linked to the fear of not being able to share the positive

            <p>Moving on offers the opportunity to indulge in things that were missed in Shanghai,

              described as “the liminal phase,” and to being integrated into a new
              social world—for Peter, this process is associated with making new friends and
              getting accepted by the university he has applied to. Peter is aware that this is a

            <p>Moving on is therefore associated with a mixture of reconnecting with old memories,

          <title>1.4. Reflections on leaving Shanghai and what lies ahead</title>
          <p>All the students featured in this work see their move away from Shanghai as a crucial
            point in their lives and as the end of an important phase. Because leaving Shanghai is
            related to their graduation from high school, they have to make numerous decisions about
            their future, their career choices, and their new residence in particular. The young
            people I interviewed approach this move with mixed feelings. While some youths’
            parents stayed in Shanghai, others moved on to different destinations than their
            children. Only Olivia jointly relocated with her parents; her schoolmates’
            families, in contrast, are spread out across various locations, which means that, from
            now on, these students will have to cross great distances to see their families.</p>
          <p>My ethnographic material illustrates clearly how the collective rituals surrounding the
            traditional celebrations of the Abitur graduation offer a vital opportunity for students
            to cope as a group with these transitions: they combine the celebration of their
            academic achievements and the end of high school with bidding Shanghai farewell.
            Conversations with Matthias and a friend of Antonia, who both left the city prior to
            graduation and thus did not get to experience these combined rituals, suggest that this
            kind of closure makes moving on easier for those students who remain in Shanghai through
            graduation. The ceremonies, traditions, and parties that mark the end of students’
            school life and their time in Shanghai evolve from a mixture of German school traditions
            and Shanghai-specific memories. It is not surprising, therefore, that the students chose
            their all-time favorite club Mural, the converted warehouse with its specatcular view of
            the Bund, and a bar in the former French concession to commemorate their graduation as
            well as to say their “goodbyes” to the city. </p>
          <p>The move away from Shanghai, which for the majority of the students means moving back
            to Germany, is also met with thoughts about what is to come. Final destinations are
            often vague until responses from universities—which are awaited with anxious
            anticipation—are received. For many, university life means making a dream (such as
            Antonia’s goal of studying medicine) come true, but also evokes a fear of feeling
            lost in a new location. The youths particularly voiced their worries about navigating
            everyday practicalities in their new home, and their reservations about whether they
            would be able to fit in.</p>
          <p>The expatriate teenagers’ plans to move sound rather definite. Although recent
            research has shown an increase in young people who move back and forth between their own
            and their parent’s homes (for more information on what has been dubbed the
            “boomerang phenomenon,” see Molgat 2002, 135), few of the students in this
            work considered returning to their parental home to be an option. This is not
            surprising, given that for the majority of them, the parental home was also dissolved in
            the next move, and is therefore not a fixed place that they can return to. Some students
            said they hoped to come back to Shanghai one day, but these ideas were never concretely
            formulated and never involved a specific plan, apart from the vague possibility of maybe
            receiving an expat post one day, too. While it remains to be seen whether these youths
            will ultimately follow in their parents’ footsteps by living highly-mobile lives,
            the next chapter concludes this ethnography by investigating how the students fared
            after moving back to Germany, their new beginnings there, and their reflections on their
            time in Shanghai.</p>

        <title>Chapter 2. New Beginnings and Concluding Thoughts</title>
        <p>After graduation, the majority of the teenagers from the German school chose to
          “return” to their “home” country, which many of them only knew
          from early childhood or holidays, and enroll at universities. Only Kressi and Bjorn opted
          to stay in Shanghai to take a Chinese language course, while two other boys moved to
          Germany to carry out their military service and plan to attend university afterwards. The
          students chose Germany as a destination because of its respected and free university
          system, to reconnect with the country as such, and, as was mentioned previously, to
          explore German student life and the associated cultural practices in general. For the
          expatriate teenagers moving “back” also meant leaving their family homes,
          which by now are out of reach or no longer exist. Many of them began to pursue studies in
          engineering, business, or, as in Antonia’s case, medicine. </p>

        <p>I keep in touch with Antonia and some of her peers and occasionally even meet with them
          at birthday parties, sightseeing trips, or for lunch or coffee. In our conversations I
          sense how much they enjoy exploring Germany, which is simultaneously a familiar, yet
          foreign country. Being privy to their initial struggles, but also their success and their
          joy in discovering new things and making new friends, I begin to realize just how
          complicated their “return” turns out to be. </p>
        <p>In November 2012, I pick up Antonia at her new place to go out for lunch. Back in
          Shanghai we would hang out at her place, but now she does not ask me to come in,
          because—she apologizes—her room looks too chaotic. She is studying constantly
          and has no time to clean up. Besides, she admits, she still has not gotten used to doing
          such things yet, as her ayi always took care of housework. After lunch we get a coffee at
          Starbucks. While I am reminded of Shanghai’s Starbucks coffee shops and ponder the
          continuity these global chains seem to provide, Antonia tells me she feels that she moved
          out too early, having just turned eighteen. Her parents are still in Shanghai. It is
          difficult for her to suddenly be on her own.</p>
        <p>Eventually, in the summer of 2014—two years after their graduation—I conduct
          structured interviews with Antonia and Mia to discuss their experiences. In our follow-up
          interview, Antonia sits in my office and, with the voice recorder and questionnaire in
          front of us, she remembers her move to Germany and her initial feelings:</p>
        <p>
          <speech id="speech383">
            <speaker>Antonia</speaker>
            <p>Moving itself went relatively, well, went really fast. I was travelling in America
              after graduation and then I went on a trip through Europe. And during the Europe trip
              I got accepted at university. I came back and had to find a flat within one week. And
              then my parents came and we moved everything and so on. I didn’t even think
              about it that much, and then university already started. […] So somehow all this
              went super fast.</p>

          </speech>
        </p>
        <p>Although very experienced in moving, Antonia’s former classmate Mia shares similar
          stories of loneliness during her first months in Germany. Both their narratives echo the
          students’ retrospective accounts of what it was like to move to Shanghai that this
          book analyzed in Part II, Chapter 1. However, there is a significant difference: in 2012,
          Antonia and Mia decided themselves to move to Germany for their studies, while years
          earlier, many of the teenagers had not only felt disregarded in their family’s
          decision-making process to move to China but had often been reluctant, or initially even
          against the idea of going abroad. </p>
        <p>Faced with the family’s relocation, the children were caught between the desire to
          stay with their peers and the wish to be with their parents. They were actively weighing
          their parents’ and their own interests. While the possibilities to explore new
          things with their family were exciting, they also feared the unpredictable experiences of
          moving to a new, unknown city. Many students therefore recalled having angrily confronted
          their parents, urging them to forgo the move. Other students said that their parents felt
          guilty for moving them out of their familiar environment, against their choice.
          Consequently, the move to Shanghai brought with it emotional challenges. This process was
          analysed in Part II, Chapter 2 as “culture shock:” students’ reactions
          to an unfamiliar urban environment, new sensorial experiences combined with the lack of
          friends and extended family, and problems within the family related to the move.</p>
        <sec>
          <title><italic>Making a home again</italic></title>
          <p>Students’ everyday practices upon arrival in Shanghai were primarily concerned
            with making Shanghai their new home and with becoming part of a new community, as I
            described in Part III, Chapter 1, which conveyed the continuous process of making sense
            of the city, not only in terms of navigation and sensory experience, but also in terms
            of positioning oneself within it—as consumers, inhabitants, or someone overwhelmed
            by the urban, sensorial landscape of Shanghai. Managing the city meant managing everyday
            life and the migration experience, for instance by learning how to navigate between
            spaces of everyday practices and consumption, by giving spaces a social meaning, or by
            dividing Shanghai into manageable, familiar areas and “the rest of the
            city.” In these analyses, practices of a retreat into familiarity already became
            apparent. Part III, Chapter 2 was concerned with notions of home. After providing a
            description of expatriate housing spaces—gated communities—it identified
            youths’ small-scale home-making practices, such as decorating their rooms, or
            having regular family dinners, as well as larger processes of locating
            “home(s)” in their transnational networks. It demonstrated that, due to the
            expatriate teenagers’ experiences of mobility, home was thought of as multiple and
            fluid, and tied to various places, items, and people. It became evident that making and
            (re)imagining homes, and collecting things to produce a sense of belonging helped the
            teenagers to cope with feelings of loneliness and enabled the rhizomatic home to
            “start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines” (<xref rid="ID7bc8b740-85f0-4552-841c-ad58a3bfe6cd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID008d890b-8845-419a-8f14-18e0c13b1c01">Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 9</xref>). </p>
          <p>For Mia, who moved with her family several times within Asia and between Asia and
            Germany, this (re)imagining and creating a home in Shanghai, as Part III, Chapter 2
            showcased, also included family routines. She had always considered her immediate family
            and the shared domestic life as the main ingredient for her feelings of being at
            home.</p>
          <p>Coming back to Germany after graduation is Mia’s first move without immediate
            family: </p>

              <speaker>Mia</speaker>
              <p>Well, I’ve moved many times, but when I came home, my parents and siblings
                were always there and asked: “How are you? How was it?” And here I came
                home to empty rooms.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, for Mia and her friends, the move to Germany is not only a first step of
            being on their own, but also a move out of the supportive expatriate
            “bubble.” Throughout their stay in Shanghai, the youths were surrounded by a
            community that shared experiences of moving. The international youths’ resulting
            perceptions of Shanghai as a space of transit (see Introduction) were accompanied by
            feelings of belonging to an expatriate community that shared spatial and social
            practices and maintained various collective ways of managing migration processes.</p>

        <sec>
          <title><italic>Shanghai’s expat community and its support</italic></title>
          <p>A central role in this community is played by international schools, as described in
            Part III, Chapter 3, which are sites for the continuous everyday routine for expatriate
            youths, as well as a place for meeting new friends. There, collective expatriate
            identities were negotiated and mediated on an everyday basis—through community
            events, the communal valuing of the school for the youths’ (cosmopolitan)
            formation, and through the admission process that required the “right”
            financial means or jobs, the “right” passports, and the “right”
            grades. Chinese nationals could only enroll in rare exceptions. Hence the schools
            brought together students from various international backgrounds, but—as with the
            gated communities described in Part II, Chapter 2—this diversity was highly
            controlled. The schools also offered parents an entrance to Shanghai’s expatria
            and fostered the development of a sense of community for many of the students and their
            families.</p>

                differences for me, somehow, I’ve always tried to stress that in the

                I’m from Shanghai. For example [...] my flatmate, for her that was completely,

          <p>Mia explains how forming new acquaintances and friends in Germany cannot offer
            strategies for dealing with high mobility and being new. Friendships take longer to
            form. From her time in the transit space of Shanghai, however. Mia and the other
            expatriate youths learned how to come to terms with initially unknown surroundings: by
            finding new things to do.</p>

          <title><italic>Exploring activities and spaces</italic></title>
          <p>In Shanghai, students like Antonia and Mia actively sought out and claimed their own
            spaces outside the gated communities and schools, which determined most of their
            everyday routines. Constructing collective age identities and exploring related spaces
            were crucial for the teenagers to gain meaning and agency in their migration experience,
            as was shown in Part IV, Chapter 2 on nightlife and Part IV, Chapter 3 on the hangout
            spot called “the shop.”</p>
          <p>To make a new home at university in Germany, Mia and Antonia apply this eagerness to
            explore new spaces and activities. Antonia, for instance, learned how to play the German
            card game Skat with her new fellow students and taught herself vegan cooking and baking.
            These activities also include reviving or strengthening old memories, habits, or ties to
            old friends or extended family in Germany. Food and family are aspects that occasionally
            evoke feelings of “return” and continuity mainly because these were also
            practiced as part of the rhizomatic home during the students’ time in Shanghai and
            elsewhere (see Part III, Chapter 2).</p>

          <title><italic>Feeling or looking foreign </italic></title>
          <p>During their first few months in Germany, Antonia and Mia also come to terms with the
            incongruity of not being recognizably foreign at first sight, while often feeling alien.
            When Mia and I meet in early summer 2013—almost a year after her move—she
            talks about everyday incidents where she has to ask for help or information, for
            instance buying tram or train tickets, and feels local citizens are annoyed and do not
            understand how she could possibly not know these things. Other students share her
            experiences. Her former schoolmate Andrea remembers feeling awkward at the post office
            for not knowing the different forms or courier services available in Germany, and for
            later having to ask a friend where to put the address on the envelope. Students
            experience that the people in their new surroundings expect them to know these things,
            simply because they look German and speak the language fluently. Such stories juxtapose
            students’ experiences of otherness in Shanghai, which I highlighted in Part IV,
            Chapter 4. In China, these white expatriate youths consciously experienced their
            physical difference as whites—many for the first time. This new and often
            uncomfortable feeling of difference promoted a preference for locations in Shanghai that
            were predominantly occupied by other whites. Many of their spatial practices therefore
            led to accepting or strengthening the exclusion of “China” from their
            everyday lives. Accompanied by special (and often preferential) treatment from Chinese
            citizens and a lack of interaction with Chinese youths, their foreign appearance fuelled
            their feelings of merely being “guests” in China. The new narratives of
            being not recognizably foreign in Germany can hence also be understood as a loss of the
            special—often experienced as privileged—treatment they received in
            Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Antonia and Mia’s reflections on their time in Shanghai and how they think it
            influenced them warrants a return to this ethnography’s initial questions that I
            raised in the Introduction: what are the experiences and consequences of growing up on
            the move? To reach a differentiated answer to this complex and difficult question, the
            theoretical foundations on which this study is built favor transcultural theories and
            their application to ethnographic research on privileged migrant youths, challenging the
            simplistic concept of TCKs that, for some time, was the common approach to categorizing
            youths like those that inform this work.</p>

          <title><italic>The role of age in the youths’ own perspectives, dependency, and
              agency</italic></title>
          <p>My first research aim was to understand the youths’ own perspectives on global
            mobility. Although teenagers experienced their move to Shanghai in many ways similar to
            the adult community, there was also a range of different, age-specific experiences.</p>
          <p>The students were minors whose move depended (solely) on the decisions of their
            parents. Their memories of leaving, examined in Part II, showed that students’
            dependence on their family and their lack of choice was always clear to them.
            Furthermore, their prescribed everyday school lives left little time and space for the
            expression of individual agency. Because they regularly shared spaces—for example
            the international schools (see Part III, Chapter 3)—with peers of the same age and
            with similar experiences, collective forms of coping with the move and the new
            environment could be forged. Together, students developed a social space distinct from
            the adult community. The teenagers claimed and frequented a variety of social meeting
            places including Shanghai’s nightclubs, or spaces that lay in-between different
            social worlds and authorities, such as the hangout place called “the shop.”
            Collectively exploring and shaping these spaces proved to be age-specific ways of
            managing the move while still remaining in a relationship of dependency from parents.
            Furthermore, youths—constantly confronted with the idea of development, of
            becoming an adult—seemed to reflect more than adults on the impact that moving and
            living in several places had on them and how this shaped their points of view and
            future. These reflections illustrate the second point of my investigation, the
            expatriate youths’ negotiations of identity.</p>

          <title><italic>Identity negotiations: demarcation and globality versus transcultural
              perspectives</italic></title>
          <p>The youths’ own perspectives illustrated throughout this ethnography, for
            instance in Part I, Chapter 4, show that common notions of home, belonging, or cultural
            identity are too limited to capture the complexities of their childhoods abroad.
            Expatriate youths live in a highly mobile and culturally complex environment and the
            teenagers found myriad ways to negotiate, forge, perform, and contest their forms of
            belonging and positions in their social worlds. My ethnographic work examined these ways
            and revealed two seemingly contradictory tendencies in their everyday practices. On the
            one hand, there are those daily activities and ways of living that maintain rigid
            cultural and class divisions, often tied to a wish for comfort and continuity, but also
            to feelings of superiority and hopes for status creation and future benefits; on the
            other hand, there are practices informed by curiosity and self-reflexivity allowing and
            fostering the emergence of transcultural perspectives.</p>
          <p>These first practices of demarcation and distinction became very apparent in the
            youths’ spatial divisions of the city into expat and non-expat places as described
            in Part III, Chapter 1, which are also succinctly illustrated in the students’
            mental maps (such as in Figure 8). These practices are also evident in the absence of
            friendships or even contact with Chinese youths (see Part IV, Chapter 4). This lack of
            exchange with local teenagers—or local citizens in general—is fostered by
            the withdrawal into gated communities with a high percentage of foreigners (see Part
            III, Chapter 2) as well as by the fact that international schools are not allowed to
            take in Chinese students due to prohibitive rules by the Chinese government (see Part
            III, Chapter 3). Engaged in practices of demarcation from the local environment, the
            young privileged migrants, nevertheless, claimed urban and cosmopolitan identities. My
            study shows that for expatriate youths, as Hindman (<xref rid="IDfea73e21-71b8-4252-b7fc-a29b9210498a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2262a22f-7122-4c2f-aabf-7dd9843b744c">2009a, 250</xref>) observed of adult
            expatriates in Nepal, “culture is important as a means of justifying their
            presence abroad,” but difference is often only allowed in a prescribed, safe
            “niche” and in a “commodifiable form” (<xref rid="IDfea73e21-71b8-4252-b7fc-a29b9210498a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID81b2f1d9-aab3-4df0-a416-8b04b47b2c25">ibid., 267</xref>). Similar to
            Brosius’ (<xref rid="ID14c544fa-1515-418d-baad-68721773b553" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa11c9ce9-f40b-45fd-9915-b26437118264">2010</xref>) investigation of the everyday
            lives of India’s middle class, such cosmopolitanism can be seen as “a
            practice of status-creation” (<xref rid="ID14c544fa-1515-418d-baad-68721773b553" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4a6603c8-62b2-45c9-a106-b810920dedcb">2010, 26</xref>).
            Shanghai’s urban environment often only provides the backdrop for learning and
            claiming cosmopolitanism or expatriateness. The skills acquired through the experiences
            in Shanghai bring status and competencies or, as Binder (<xref rid="ID5784a023-edca-4603-a962-615d4f39eb34" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbc897b71-15ec-4c0d-9fb6-042dbc9b9bbc">2005</xref>) calls it,
            “globality,” to the youths. This globality must be seen as a cultural
            resource in the Bourdieusian sense—as capital. The ways in which students imagine
            their future careers proved this particularly well. Growing up abroad and receiving an
            international education are considered by expatriate students (see Part III, Chapter 3)
            and the community—as the graduation speech held by the principle of the German
            school illustrated in the previous chapter—to be clear benefits of global
            mobility. In Shanghai, the international schools consider providing, fostering, and
            ultimately transforming their students’ global experiences into globality and
            capital, to be part of their educational duties. Globality is a community marker and
            value. However, while international schools foster an international community that sees
            itself as open-minded, diverse, and cosmopolitan, they do so without including the local
            neighborhood, Shanghai, or China as a whole. While expatriate youths and their families
            create their own communities, often revolving around these schools, they demarcate
            themselves from Shanghai “locals” as well as from those back
            “home”—both are perceived as lacking international experience. The
            performance of a collective expatriate identity is thus not only tied to aspiring to and
            learning cosmopolitan values, but simultaneously connected to practices of demarcation
            from “others” perceived as less mobile, globally connected, and
            educated.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, looking at these processes, the age-specific context has to be kept in
            mind: parents play the major role in planning their children’s lives and making
            decisions in their “best interest” (<xref rid="IDfa1a348d-b01e-4963-a17f-0adfb50e9d47" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb27a4104-12d2-4699-b7c9-78a2cea6430c">see Ackers and Stalford 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ID28adb433-e671-45bb-93bf-a89b2fbefb1b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID58de0f07-4d81-44ad-9440-c373dc4067c4">Hutchins 2011</xref>), as exemplified in
            youths’ retrospectives on leaving in Part II, Chapter 1. </p>
          <p>In my view, many “expatriates’ places” in Shanghai were not spaces
            that particularly fostered the process of transculturation because transculturation
            means a process of allowing space for difference (<xref rid="IDa871b605-1750-4cdb-ac3c-b3fd8c9fa1fe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3bfd68a6-4f38-490b-8e6f-31e1bcfe1fed">Hoerder, Hébert, and Schmitt
              2005</xref>), rather than leaving difference outside the walls, putting it in a
            “niche,” or staging it at as the “other.” These demarcation
            processes, which circumscribe so much of the teenagers’ lives in Shanghai, could
            render the application of the term “transcultural” to the accumulation of
            experiences that I identified as globality far-fetched. After all,
            “transculturation is the process of individuals and societies changing themselves
            by integrating diverse cultural life-ways into dynamic new ones” (<xref rid="IDa871b605-1750-4cdb-ac3c-b3fd8c9fa1fe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3420504b-00f8-40bb-8126-6ca2cd8f1287">Hoerder, Hébert, and Schmitt
              2005</xref>, 13). </p>
          <p>However, my ethnography revealed that the young migrants’ activities and
            viewpoints were significantly informed by curiosity and self-reflexivity, thus allowing
            and fostering the emergence of transcultural perspectives. When spending time with
            youths and listening to their subjective experiences of their transient stays in
            Shanghai, I encountered many reflections that were concerned with culturally complex
            entanglements, experiences, and challenges that forced these teenagers to position
            themselves in a world that others often culturally divide for them. These subjective
            experiences of in-between positions linked to processes of transculturation complicated
            and challenged the focus on demarcation and status-gain that I had witnessed and which
            other studies on expatriates have focused on. The examined processes of identity
            positioning and the meaning of the stay for different expatriate teenagers, as
            highlighted in Part I, Chapter 4, as well as their fluid, translocal, and multiple
            conceptions of home and belonging, as analyzed in Part III, Chapter 2, showed that the
            generation of expatriate teenagers that I worked with was often forced to negotiate
            difference, regardless of how hermetic the expat “bubble” may have seemed.
            In contrast to their parents, some children lacked a deep understanding of their
            “home culture,” since some of them had only been born in their “home
            country” but left it at a very early age; others only knew “their”
            country from the occasional holiday spent there with family. Furthermore, many of the
            youths came from mixed marriages or were second generation migrants who had become
            mobile again and “returned” to China for a certain period. Many of the
            expatriate teenagers I met therefore had to find ways to bridge differences between
            parents, or school and parents, on a daily basis, and from an early age. Additionally,
            being in China provoked reflections on social practices and shared values. Some
            students, like Karina, who after her stay chose to major in Chinese at college, or those
            like Antonia, Charlie, Don, or Arnaud, who had Chinese family backgrounds, continuously
            reflected upon their own “Chineseness.” In short, the specifity of China
            mattered. </p>
          <p>Furthermore, the move’s impact on relationship networks—such as being away
            from extended family and friends—triggered all the students to think about
            themselves, their cultural identities, and what was important for them to feel at home.
            Some reflected on cultural or educational influences (see for example Paul’s
            thoughts in the Introduction, or those of Antonia, Xia, and Arnaud in Part IV, Chapter
            1), while others considered mostly class and their expatriate status (see Bjorn’s
            comments, also in Part IV, Chapter 1). While my influence as an ethnographer cannot be
            denied, these findings resonate with Melissa Butcher’s description of Australian
            transnational professionals and their experiences in Asia: “Transnational movement
            subsequently engenders a process of identity re-evaluation as mobility, and inevitable
            contact with difference, disrupt the familiar cultural frames of reference that underpin
            identities, including established relationship networks” (<xref rid="IDbb4223f7-83ce-425c-b3a8-377a2804f547" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9c137142-470b-4fa7-9bd0-75ab87545b6d">Butcher 2009, 1354</xref>).</p>
          <p>My ethnography, therefore, recognizes the students’ emerging abilities to cope
            with changes and difference as part of the development of a transcultural perspective.
            It is this transcultural perspective that enabled them to reflect upon their culturally
            complex environment and its meanings for and influences on their own positions and
            narratives of the self. These transcultural perspectives functioned as tools to re-find
            spaces and moments of comfort in diverse and mobile cultural contexts, whether at an
            American or German school, an expatriate nightlife location, at Chinese
            grandparents’ homes, or in mixed-marriage family life.</p>

          <p>My third research aim was to analyze expatriate youths’ everyday spatial
            practices and their (dis)engagement with the “local.” Dynamic relations
            between spatial boundaries, their transgressions, and the claiming of expatriate and age
            identities were brought sharply to the fore in my examination of students’
            everyday practices of social space. Youths in Shanghai experienced less spatial and
            social constraints than youths in Europe, particularly regarding access to restaurants,
            bars, and nightclubs (see Part IV). Despite this relative sense of freedom, Shanghai
            students experienced most of the everyday spaces they frequented as highly regulated due
            to the strict processes of demarcation that the expatriate community undertook to define
            for itself; examples are the spaces of the gated communities and the international
            schools (Part III).</p>
          <p>Students’ practices in these spaces were diverse and contradictory. Looking at
            “diaspora space” (<xref rid="ID3488cac3-f6eb-4110-8d65-0fc23839b56c" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2876a871-73b1-45c7-9d61-bbcd0dc63754">Brah 1996</xref>) in
            Shanghai—the encounters and moments of entanglement between the privileged
            migrants and those who stayed in Shanghai—it became clear that a strong
            local-expat divide was maintained, making the transgressions difficult for expatriate
            teenagers in general. Only a few locations, like the shop, provided a shared space for
            locals and expat youths. But while the shop played a central role, it is set outside the
            glamorous image of the metropolis, and it is this image, rather than any direct,
            unregulated involvement with its actual inhabitants and spaces, that led to
            students’ identifications with Shanghai. Nevertheless, the teenagers’
            turning towards the city’s transnational spaces and aiming to be part of the
            city’s cosmopolitan image still professes, at least to some extent, their
            engagement with the contemporary situation in China’s megalopolis. The
            relationship between expatriate youths and their physical environment shapes their
            everyday lives as much as the expatriate networks that they belong to. Their interaction
            with their immediate surroundings offers a way to not only cope with the difficulties of
            the overall migration experience, but also to represent this experience as worthwhile
            and successful. Shanghai’s urban environment provided students with the backdrop
            for learning and claiming certain forms of cosmopolitan identity that I have identified
            specifically as “expatriateness” (see Part III, Chapter 3). </p>

          <title><italic>Returning to where?</italic></title>
          <p>Although Shanghai is an exciting city, the majority of the teenagers from the German
            school chose to “return” to their “home” country, which many of
            them only knew from early childhood or holidays. However, as Antonia and Mia’s
            accounts show, there is no simple homecoming to a certain, stable status quo. The idea
            of “home,” as I argue throughout this ethnography, is a complicated matter
            and is tied to various emotions and places. Home is also a matter of perspective.</p>
          <p>Two years after leaving China, the idea of “return,” for Mia and Antonia,
            is becoming linked to Shanghai: the city is still a connecting place in their
            friendships to which they frequently retreat—imagined, virtually, or
            physically—to strengthen their ties and to find emotional support. During an
            interview in the summer of 2014, Mia and I are sitting in her room in a shared student
            flat and I inquire about her current relationship to Shanghai. Mia explains when and how
            she and her friends remember the city:</p>

                really, pretty much every day. But of course it is sometimes stronger and sometimes
                weaker. But, erm, for example if you, if friends who still live there, if they post
                pictures, then you’re always like, “oh, how beautiful,” and then I

          <p>To former expatriate youths, “returning” is a practice of remembering and
            reviving old connections while simultaneously establishing new ones and exploring new
            places, rather than moving back to a fixed geographical location or network. </p>
          <p>Despite a “return” to Germany, their lives are still characterized by ties
            to diverse locations and by global mobility. Consequently, although feelings of
            belonging to the new environment are being established, they are often also experienced
            as contested. For expatriate youths spaces of “home” and notions of
            “return” also remain extremely mobile—perhaps especially after leaving
            the transit space of Shanghai and moving to those countries that issued their
            passports.</p>

          <title><italic>My personal stance</italic></title>
          <p>The narratives of the teenagers’ experience as they passed through Shanghai have
            often touched me. Their simultaneous ignorance, acceptance, and unwarranted
            transgressions of cultural boundaries at times irritated me, and their occasional lack
            of interest in Chinese society shocked me. Their attempts and abilities to cope with
            constant change and difference impressed me, and their honest reflections upon and
            willingness to share their own lives enlightened me. To capture their positions, which
            are on the one hand marked by privilege, and on the other by extreme dependence and
            painful uprootings, was a personal and academic challenge; as I have shown, the
            characteristics and the varieties of teenagers’ experiences of privileged
            migration are very diverse. But all these youths considered passing through Shanghai a
            chance to gain a new outlook. It remains to be seen if, in time, these transcultural
            perspectives will manifest themselves either in rigid identity positions that claim
            cosmopolitanism or globality solely for themselves (see my argumentation against the
            concept of TCKs in the Introduction), or if they will instead be able to keep their
            flexibility and creative ways of incorporating difference.</p>
          <p> It is beyond the aim of this ethnography to make concrete recommendations on extended
            family stays abroad, but the stories in this book suggest—at least to
            me—that it is wise to involve children in the decision-making process and, once
            the decision is made, in the preparations for the move. Furthermore, while it is
            important to create a familiar comfort zone, parents can also set an example of how to
            engage with new environments by not simply withdrawing into “bubbles.” I am
            convinced that open-mindedness and a shared eagerness to explore can help all family
            members make their stay more meaningful than the advancement of the breadwinner’s
            career alone ever could. Such an attitude can support children in forging new
            experiences into self-reflective transcultural perspectives that are based on an empathy
            for and appreciation of differences, and to help overcome the rigid divisions of
            nationality, gender, class, or ethnicity that are still present in all our lives.</p>

          <title><italic>Future studies</italic></title>
          <p>Many questions remain unanswered. I want to address four points that are worth, even
            crucial to, exploration in further research.</p>
          <p>First, now that I have traced the “here-and-now” (<xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="ID27d4f189-56d2-42d3-91b5-e867fc1ba8db">Bucholtz 2002, 532</xref>) of
            students’ migration experiences, their future paths could be explored. A
            longitudinal approach is necessary to trace the impact of growing up on the move on
            their future careers and lifestyle choices. The influence of the teenager’s social
            situations on their educational and career trajectories has long been caught in a
            conundrum of structure versus agency (<xref rid="ID98f705d7-b24a-488b-9651-3fa34e50f16e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2d378d12-392e-455b-bbf3-a348490572bd">Milner 2004,
              15–17</xref>). As suggested earlier, following the ways in which expatriate
            children, such as my informants, exercise their privileged upbringing and what kind of
            rigid or mobile subjectivities they will choose to keep as identity references would be
            a worthwhile endeavour.</p>
          <p>Second, I agree with Fechter and Walsh (<xref rid="IDcbcc34b5-a079-41ed-a6e4-2b7fc8bae7dc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDff2fe369-98f7-40df-a53e-945f589ffd6d">2010, 1207</xref>), who point to the need
            to “produce research that does engage with locals’ perspectives on
            expatriates in a variety of contexts.” For studies looking at expatriates in
            China, this means we need a focus on Chinese locals’ points of view on expatriates
            to flesh out issues such as demarcations between the communities and the lack of contact
            between locals and expatriates, or to investigate the complex dynamics of race in
            everyday life in China.</p>
          <p>Third, the question of what role China specifically played in the students’
            development remains partly unanswered and also constitutes a significant concern for
            further research on the topic of expatriate youths. To address this concern
            meaningfully, comparative research on expatriate youths’ experiences in other
            locations is needed. Although Chinese or Shanghainese particularities have been pointed
            out in the present study, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the
            “host” country influenced the age-specific experience of these privileged
            migrants. While the practices of demarcation and boundary drawing, for instance, seem to
            be very similar to those of adult expatriate communities—whether in Jakarta (<xref rid="IDf82585c1-f9a0-4cdf-a1ae-0e56578b02bb" ref-type="bibr" id="IDda4d8ab2-2fc1-46a6-9fc2-26d5a5ff6c02">Fechter 2007a</xref>; <xref rid="IDd96188de-372e-4b1c-82cd-5cbbb2aafc03" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9363261f-d863-4cca-928f-57c13f480150">Fechter 2007b</xref>), Dubai (<xref rid="ID1bd2d3ed-27bd-4ca3-a0a3-52b36b8dc141" ref-type="bibr" id="ID25f84f9f-e49c-49d2-b3e7-4cb418259524">Walsh 2006a</xref>; <xref rid="ID8a8cf319-3fa5-4d9e-aa08-ae21cc3f82b1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf0d43de3-1b84-48a4-912a-94c0b08d2d33">Walsh 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="ID85b9d7d9-d9e2-4f92-9923-6a4386966ed9" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0f8e0437-e91e-4a62-953e-9349776c869f">Walsh 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ID37c27be2-f695-4689-8682-fd81f096bc39" ref-type="bibr" id="IDef32cebe-c237-44b9-96e9-a699af0b7c3e">Walsh 2011</xref>), Singapore (<xref rid="ID4db4d41b-22cd-4411-82e4-5d5660b5931d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID061f4308-1e2a-414f-972c-a23c4afed0c9">Beaverstock 2002</xref>; <xref rid="IDf7ddf8f7-15a4-41d1-8a88-ccfd5896cf05" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbef08c2e-c06e-4014-8eef-50489df8d61a">Beaverstock 2011</xref>), Nepal (<xref rid="IDfea73e21-71b8-4252-b7fc-a29b9210498a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8606c39c-5474-4019-b6c3-dfaa14710db7">Hindman 2009a</xref>; <xref rid="IDcf8a54f2-f840-428f-ba53-392218f338e1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID67fd448d-6d4b-411f-8546-df10d2a1814f">Hindman 2009b</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref rid="ID6b47e04b-a79c-4729-8c6f-9fea94212700" ref-type="bibr" id="ID42538d87-0de2-4459-82c5-af2ca2099624">Yeoh and Willis 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ID6e0ec397-9807-49f6-bc8e-5c7d4b43aaab" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1a709448-b51a-4936-b2a0-98d30ca53b79">Willis and Yeoh 2008</xref>), Sao Paulo

            youths’ experiences can vary greatly in respect to the schools they attend.
            Different school systems and the enrollment of local students in other countries could
            make mixing with “local” youths easier elsewhere than it is in Shanghai,
            where the spaces to interact are particularly limited.</p>
          <p>Lastly, a study that brings together experiences of privileged and less privileged
            forms of youth migration would undoubtedly yield important insights into
            children’s strategies of coping with family migration generally. Combining these
            research fields, which until now have been approached separately, can, for example,
            highlight the challenges, but also the strengths and capabilities of young migrants from
            less privileged backgrounds, who are often marginalized because of their circumstances
            and whose skills often remain unacknowledged. The longing for continuity and reminders
            of “home” that expatriate youths experience can provide a much-needed bridge
            to understanding practices of migration that are perceived as foreign or not adapted
            enough—something which politicians or media in western societies tend to dismiss
            as leading towards a “parallel society.” In this context, combined research
            into the various forms of youth migration can elucidate the important role played by
            institutional support, for example from schools. </p>
          <p>The teenagers I accompanied were privileged in many ways and their advantaged
            positions, which allowed them to compensate for the losses and anxieties that moving
            brought with it, are in stark, even shocking contrast to the hundreds of thousands of
            refugees that are currently seeking asylum in Europe. Comparing these different
            circumstances, along with the agency that children and teenagers can develop by coming
            to terms with them, could inform policies and services that help migrant children and
            youths with the challenges they have to face. The resulting insights could contribute to
            establishing adequate assistance at schools and community centers and to creating shared
            spaces that encourage self-reflection and the development of the transcultural
            perspectives needed to manage the consequences of global mobility.</p>

        <title>B. Student Directory: Who’s Who?</title>
        <p>Only those youths whose interview quotes are directly cited in the ethnography are listed here. I interviewed more students, for example from a Singaporean school, whose experiences inform my work, but as they do not appear as individuals in the book, I decided not to provide their background information.</p>
        <p><bold>Alex</bold>, age eighteen, was the oldest boy in the German class I visited. I interviewed Alex together with Don and Bjorn. Alex enjoyed the attention he received during the interview, which initially he equated with a journalistic interview, suggesting an impression of fame or importance. Alex was born in Germany, but later moved to Brussels with his family. After living in Brussels (where Alex attended a German school) for a few years, his parents decided to move to Shanghai for the advancement of his father’s career. Alex came to Shanghai when he was almost seventeen years old. Alex, along with his best friend Don (“the girls” labeled their relationship a “bromance”), was always very involved in nightlife activities and often initiated the Friday nights out. “The boys” hung out at his place quite regularly. Alex was the only boy who had casual relationships with Chinese girls he met at the nightclubs. Alex moved back to Germany after graduation and is currently studying film.</p>
        <p><bold>Allen</bold>, an American, was eleven years old when I interviewed him at his British school in November, 2010. He had just arrived in Shanghai: his father had been transferred to China for work three months prior. Before his move to Shanghai, his family had spent over a year in Mexico, leaving early, however, due to what Allen referred to as “security reasons.” Allen phrased every thought carefully, which, along with his school uniform (sports coat, shirt, and a tie) and his way of quietly reading while waiting for his classmates Jacob and Tamara to appear for the group interview, made him seem rather grown up. Although sharing his thoughts on moving to Shanghai in a very reflective and circumspect way, his position seemed to be one of copying his parents’ stance of maintaining a positive attitude and focusing on the benefits of growing up transnationally. He emphasised that he thinks this approach is important refused to discuss any uncertainties, difficulties, or homesickness he might have felt. Instead, he stressed that he trusts his parents and their decision-making process. However, he recalled that he had gotten sick in Mexico and attributed this to the radical change of environment and the host of new impressions he was exposed to. Allen, in his analytical and calm way, embodied what I have often experienced as a typically American attitude of looking at the positive aspects of a situation. Yet he was someone I kept wondering about because I was curious as to what really lay behind his positive attitude and whether his strategy really worked. Unfortunately, I was not able to stay in touch with Allen after leaving Shanghai.</p>
        <p><bold>Andrea</bold>, aged sixteen at our first encounter, is a quirky, creative student who likes to make people laugh. During my fieldwork, she had a particular reputation for partying and dancing Shanghai’s nights away together with Antonia. Andrea was born in Japan, but was too young to actively remember her first years there. She started school in Germany, but when she was twelve years old, her family left for Shanghai due to her father’s career. In our conversations, she recalled that the move and the first few years at her new school were quite difficult. I interviewed Andrea individually three times: in June and September of 2011 and in June of 2012, at a café in Shanghai’s former French Concession. I first met her on a Friday night out. Andrea, the only one of “the girls” who attended a different class, was one of the few students who lived downtown. While it took some time for us to get to know each other, we got along very well towards the end of my stay and kept in touch after she moved back to Germany to study communications. She is currently writing her Bachelor’s thesis and is looking for opportunities to pursue a Master’s degree.</p>
        <p><bold>Antonia</bold> was sixteen when I first met her at the German school. She was born in Germany, but grew up in Shanghai. She was one of the few expat students who had been at the same school since she began her studies. Her father is German, and her mother a successful Chinese businesswoman who studied in Germany. When we talked about her relationship with the city and her experiences in China, Antonia stressed how she differed from other expatriate children who only spend, on average, a few years in China. Antonia speaks both German and Chinese at home and likes to claim that she is “Shanghainese.” She is a determined young woman, who has high expectations of herself, and highly values intelligence and analytical minds. Consequently, she can sometimes appear to be abrupt and direct in her judgment of others and herself. She is generous, independent, and does not shy away from arguments. During my fieldwork, the other students sometimes called her Antonio, because they considered some of her behavior to be masculine. Antonia was a key figure in my research, not only as an informant and friend, but also as a gatekeeper. It was her invitation to join nightlife activities that led to closer contacts with many others at the German school. Her way of including me and openly stating that “Marie ist eine von uns” (Marie is one of us) significantly impacted my acceptance as a researcher and friend into her peer group and class. I have visited Antonia several times since she moved to Germany and we are still in touch. She is now studying medicine.</p>
        <p><bold>Arnaud</bold> was sixteen years old and enrolled at a French school in Shanghai when I met him. He was born in Belgium, after his Chinese-born parents moved there for his father’s studies and career. Arnaud is a Belgian national. When he was five years old, his family moved to the outskirts of Paris. When he was nine, his family decided to move to Shanghai because of a career opportunity for his father, as well as to be closer to his sick grandfather. I received Arnaud’s phone number from Matthias. Arnaud and I agreed to meet at a Starbucks downtown, where he appeared with his long, black hair tied into a ponytail, wearing head phones. After carefully studying the interview questionnaire, he answered the questions in a circumspect way. I had short conversations with him after that, whenever I ran into him at the school, and we exchanged a few messages via Facebook. I particularly enjoyed the interview with Arnaud because he was very self-reflective and openly shared the difficulties of negotiating his position as an Asian-looking teenager who had been raised in Europe by Chinese parents. He often felt that it is impossible to succeed in either of the two worlds and feared alienation from his parents, particularly his mother. Arnaud was very driven creatively: he was involved in school plays and bands, and wrote short stories. This tireless engagement seemed to help him cope with the cultural entanglements of his world. After his graduation, Arnaud moved to Canada to study music recording. We are still in touch via the web.</p>
        <p><bold>Bjorn</bold>, a German student, was sixteen years old at the time of our first interview. I met Bjorn because he was in one of the classes at the German school that I was allowed to audit. At first, I noticed his Bavarian accent, which was rather uncommon among the other German students in Shanghai who spoke standard German. While our origins within Germany differed, we established a connection through our similar music taste, which allowed for easier and more detailed discussions on other issues. Bjorn had just arrived in Shanghai when I was conducting my fieldwork there in the summer of 2010. He had never lived outside the small Bavarian village that he grew up in and expressed that, initially, he was against moving to China. Nonetheless, Bjorn quickly established friendships with his classmates. He even functioned as the major link between “the girls” and “the boys” in the class. Perhaps not surprisingly, Bjorn was, for this reason, one of the students I felt most comfortable talking to and became, along with Matthias, one of my key male informants. After I left, Bjorn stayed in Shanghai for another year, before he moved back to Germany, to be trained as a teacher.</p>
        <p><bold>Britta</bold>, from Norway, was seventeen-year-old student at a British school when she took part in a group discussion with two of her fellow students. The discussion had been organized by the school principal’s assistant. She, along with her parents and younger sister Freda, had only arrived in Shanghai a couple of months prior, due to her father’s career. This was her first stay abroad. Britta found the adjustment particularly challenging in terms of academics. She followed the IB (International Baccalaureate) curriculum at her school. Switching to English-medium education and a new school system had caused her grades to drop. This worried her particularly because two years before graduation her grades would determine which college she could enter. Consequently, she was considering returning to Norway after the first term to stay with relatives or her best friend’s family, in order to obtain a high school diploma with a stronger academic record. Unfortunately, I was not able to stay in touch with Britta.</p>
        <p><bold>Charlie</bold> was sixteen years old when I first met her. Her parents were both born in China and met in Germany during their studies at university. They eventually became German nationals and Charlie was consequently born and raised in Germany. At the age of twelve, she and her family moved to Shanghai for her fathers’ career. Charlie can be described as friendly, helpful, and having a sunny disposition, but she also has a keen sense of justice and can be easily angered over unfair actions, whether committed against herself or others. Charlie took part in a group discussion with Olivia and Andrea, but I also interviewed her twice individually in September 2011 and in June 2012. During my fieldwork, I felt that she often underestimated her abilities and often needlessly worried about her high school diploma (Abitur) and whether her grades would suffice to study medicine. Charlie and I got along very well and at times even met socially, for example for shopping sprees at Shanghai’s eyeglasses market. After her graduation, Charlie moved to Germany while her parents and her younger sister stayed in Shanghai. She now studies medicine and we have met several times since her move.</p>
        <p><bold>Don</bold> was sixteen when I first met him during class at the German school in December 2010. A few weeks later, I interviewed him along with Bjorn and Alex. Don was born in Germany to Chinese-born parents and moved to Shanghai when he was twelve. Although I did not conduct any individual interviews with him, we often ran into each other at school and met during nights out. Don and Alex were close friends and often seemed inseparable. Don was particularly interested in electronic music and was an active member of the peer group that students mostly referred to as “the boys.” After graduation, he moved to Germany and is currently studying to become an engineer. </p>
        <p><bold>Emily</bold>, age twelve when I met her, was born in Malaysia, but left when she was too young to retain any memories of living there. When we became acquainted, Emily had already lived in Malaysia, Beijing, and Thailand. She had arrived in Shanghai one and a half years prior to the interview and attended a British school. I interviewed her with fellow students Britta and Kazuo in a group discussion in November 2010.</p>
        <p><bold>Freda</bold> was fifteen years old when I interviewed her with Keith and Vijay. She was from Norway, where she had lived all her life until moving to Shanghai with her parents and sister in 2010, just a few months prior to the group discussion. She was enrolled at a British school and is Britta’s younger sister.</p>
        <p><bold>Giovanni</bold>, who was seventeen years old when we met, was a rather quiet but cheerful student at the German school. At first, we hardly spoke and all I knew about him was that he was Swiss—seemingly his defining characteristic when other students at the German school referred to him. Although I had met him at school and during the peer group’s nights out—he would regularly join Bjorn, Alex, Don, Peter, and Marco—it was only during my first follow-up stay in September 2011 that we conducted an interview and I had the chance to hear his own story. Giovanni was born in Switzerland and spent his elementary school years in Istanbul, where his father was on an assignment. After returning to Switzerland for a few years, his family moved to Shanghai, a decision his father had to make within a few days of being presented with the option. Giovanni was in ninth grade at the time. At the time of the interview, Giovanni and his family had been living in Shanghai for three years and he had started his penultimate year at school. We met for a follow-up interview just after his graduation in June 2012. Giovanni planned to study economics after completing his training in the Swiss army. </p>
        <p><bold>Jacob</bold>, who was nine years old when we met, was the youngest student I interviewed. He took part in a group discussion in November 2010 at an international British school, one and a half years after his family’s move to Shanghai. Jacob had lived in Malaysia, Beijing, and Thailand. Jacob is Emily’s younger brother.</p>
        <p><bold>Karina</bold>, who is half-Czech, half-German, was seventeen when we met. She had come to Shanghai six months before our first interview in early 2011. Karina was born in Prague, where she lived until her fifth birthday. Her family then moved to Germany for three years, followed by a three year stay in the north of China, then moved back to her home town of Prague. In 2010, her family moved to China again, this time to Shanghai. I became acquainted with Karina at the German school. Karina, a native speaker of German and Czech and who is fluent in English and French, enjoyed studying Chinese, which she had started upon her arrival in Shanghai. However, despite her bicultural family and her former experiences with moving, Karina found her family’s relocation to Shanghai difficult, because she was so far away from her family and friends in Prague. When I first met Karina, her position in class was still that of a newcomer. Karina and her classmate Lara sat next to each other at that time. When I first interviewed them, they both stated that they felt alienated from the other girls in class, who had all been in Shanghai longer than they had. Karina sensed that the school environment was highly competitive and missed the level of group support she had experienced at her former international school in Prague. I later conducted individual interviews with Karina followed and, over time, we developed a trusting relationship in which she would share the problems moving to Shanghai had caused, as well as her holiday adventures. I learned about the bullying she had to go through in class, in particular from a few boys, and how this had lead to an emotional outburst on her part, and the involvement of teachers at the school. Although the situation improved and she became friends with students from the other eleventh grade class, Karina never really became part of any of the peer groups in her own class. Whether as a cause or consequence, Karina disliked the nightlife activities that the other girls in her class would organize and, therefore, did not take part in any. During a follow-up interview a year after her arrival, in September 2011, Karina still felt homesick for her extended family and friends in Prague. We stayed in touch via email and Facebook throughout her last year in Shanghai, when I had already returned to Germany. When we met again in June 2012, she was excited to move on to Germany for her studies, hoping to rejoin old friends. She had very much withdrawn from school life, also due to health problems, and did not find the time for an interview. We are no longer in touch.</p>
        <p><bold>Kazuo,</bold> a sixteen-year-old Japanese boy, had moved to Shanghai one and a half years prior to the group interview with Emily and Britta, in November 2010. He had also lived in Japan and Thailand. It was the first time that he had been enrolled at an English-language school, which, at first, he considered a great challenge. He spoke English with a slight Japanese accent and answered interview questions in a very shy manner.</p>
        <p><bold>Keith </bold>was fourteen years old when he took part in a group discussion with Freda and Vijay in November 2010, at a British school. Keith came from Singapore and had moved to Shanghai at the age of three, due to his parents’ work. He speaks Chinese fluently. </p>
        <p><bold>Kressi</bold> was fifteen when we first met at the German school where I was allowed to work. She was born in Germany, to Vietnamese parents with Cantonese roots, but had moved to Shanghai at an early age and seemed to have family all over the world. Like Mia, she had skipped a grade and was one of the youngest in her class. I regularly spent time with Kressi, as she gradually became part of “the girls” over the school year. I also interviewed her twice with Mia, in February and September 2011, and once individually, in June 2012. Due to her interest in fashion and arts, it was Kressi and her friend who put together the film for the awards ceremony in Berlin, where the German school received a prize for its outstanding art department. After graduation, Kressi decided to stay in Shanghai with Bjorn, whom she started dating a year prior to graduation, to take one semester of Chinese at Jiaotong University. While she originally had thought about studying event management, PR, or something related to the arts and fashion, she eventually moved to Germany to study economics.</p>
        <p><bold>Lara</bold> is half Dutch, half German, and was sixteen years old when we met. She had grown up in Germany until her parents announced that they would move to Shanghai in the summer of 2010. I met Lara at the German school and conducted one group interview with her and Karina, the two new girls in the class. A strong soccer player, Lara became captain of the girl’s team at her school, an activity which she enjoyed. However, Lara had difficulty getting along with the girls in her grade. I quite often accompanied her during nightlife activities, where she mainly joined “the boys” peer group that her then-boyfriend Peter belonged to. On several occasions, Lara and I were the only females in the group exploring Shanghai’s clubs, which was the foundation of a friendly connection. Although she was comfortable talking to me at clubs or during school breaks, Lara never conducted a second interview. Lara was very active on Facebook and managed to stay in touch with her old friends that way. When difficulties adjusting to the academic environment led to her voluntarily repeat the eleventh grade, Lara found new friends in Shanghai. By June 2012, she seemed to have finally settled into life in Shanghai. We are no longer in touch.</p>
        <p><bold>Marco</bold> is half-Brazilian, half-German, and was seventeen years old when we met. He grew up in Germany and spent his summers in Brazil until he moved to Shanghai one and a half years prior to the interview. Marco was enrolled at the German school and I was introduced to him during a Friday night out, by the students I usually spent time with during class. I conducted one long interview with him and his classmate and friend Peter. After that, we occasionally chatted during school outings or at nightlife venues. Marco and his family were one of the few families living in downtown Shanghai, in the former French concession. Although this made his commute to school quite long, he enjoyed his home’s proximity to bars and cafés. Due to his physical distance from school, he joined an international capoeira group rather than participating in extracurricular activities at his school.</p>
        <p><bold>Matthias</bold> and I met at the German School in spring 2011. With his long hair and clothes related to heavy-metal culture, he looked quite different from most of the other students, which led to his nickname Metalmatze. With his in-ear headphones always dangling from the collar of his black T-shirt, he was one of the more quiet characters in school. He only began to open up when we started talking about the bands he was part of, the jam sessions he enjoyed with some of the French students, and how he was making a small income as a drum teacher. After discussing these other topics, he seemed less shy and was more willing to tell me about his Shanghai experience. Matthias turned out to be a crucial link to my meeting students from other international schools and introduced me to several of his friends. He had moved to Shanghai at the age of twelve and was—by the time I met him when he was eighteen—about to return to Germany. We frequently talked about his immediate plans: after his initial plans, which included the hope of traveling to Australia, had to be put aside and he was forced to look for a career path, he decided to join the German army for one year. His parents and sister stayed on in Shanghai and he moved to his grandparents’ house in Germany. Once in the German army, however, he stayed primarily at the barracks. We stayed in touch via Facebook and I eventually visited his new home in Germany. He proudly showed me around his flat, which was located close to his grandparents’ house. For a follow-up interview, Matthias also visited me for an afternoon in Heidelberg, where we discussed how he felt about moving back to Germany. At the time, he was particularly grateful for his army experience, which made his return easier by providing him with a new routine. Matthias also reconnected with old elementary schools friends in his former hometown. We both returned to Shanghai for the graduation ceremony of his former classmates. After his time in the army, Matthias completed an apprenticeship and is currently making plans to study business and information technology.</p>
        <p><bold>Mia</bold> was fifteen when I met her and was one of the youngest students in the eleventh grade of the German school. Born in Germany, she grew up in Singapore, and then moved to Berlin before her first stay in Shanghai. After a few years there, her family relocated to Hong Kong for one year, and then returned to Shanghai. Mia remembered this return as being particularly difficult because everyone expected her to be familiar with Shanghai. However, her social environment had changed significantly during her year of absence: some friends had moved on while others had forged new friendships of which she was not part. Additionally, when she returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, Mia skipped one grade along with her close friend Kressi. This was when I met Mia, who was friendly and open, but always seemed weighed down by the pressure of her high expectations for herself. Diligent, ambitious, and well-organized, she was always the right person to ask about class schedules or dates for school events. Mia only occasionally joined nightlife activities because, at the age of fifteen, her parents would not allow her to go out very often. With her best friend Kressi, she shared interests in fashion, arts, and design. Mia was active in the school theater group and was widely admired for her way with words—I found out why when we stayed in touch via email upon my return to Germany. Her emails were always a pleasure to read. Apart from our frequent interaction at school, dinners with “the girls,” or occasional nightlife activities, I talked to Mia about her Shanghai experience in two group interviews with Kressi in February and September 2011, as well as in an individual interview, in June 2012. She and her family returned to Germany after her graduation and Mia then began college, where she lived on her own. In 2013, feeling dissatisfied with her choice of studies, she moved back in with her family and began an internship. During an online chat, she emphasized how much she missed Shanghai and her community there. Mia thought about alternative study programs and eventually chose to pursue architecture. When I conducted an interview with her in the summer of 2014, nine months after she had begun her course and moved to a new town, she was very happy with her decision.  </p>
        <p><bold>Olivia</bold> was sixteen when I met her. She is from Belgium and had lived in Germany for several years before her family moved to Shanghai, in 2007. Due to her upbringing in Germany and her German education, she is fully bilingual. In Shanghai, she also attended a German-medium school. Additionally, she had Flemish class once a week after school, to be trained to write in her mother tongue. Olivia was part of “the girls” and I spent many days and nights out with her and her friends. I interviewed her once in a group setting, with Antonia and Charlie in early 2011, and conducted a further follow-up interview with her individually, in June 2012. Olivia was always friendly and supportive of my project. She knew many students from other schools and tried to help me arrange more interviews. At school, everyone admired Olivia for her beauty. She was very active on Facebook and we often exchanged messages during my time away from Shanghai. We are still in touch today. After graduation, she started studying in her parents’ hometown in Belgium.</p>
        <p><bold>Paul</bold> was seventeen years old when we first met. He was born in Brazil and has a Brazilian mother and a German father. He is fluent in English and Portuguese; his German, however, is only basic. Paul grew up in Brazil and the United States and moved to Shanghai six years prior to our interview in May 2011. At that time, he was just about to graduate from a private, American Christian school and was making plans to move to Germany for college. His father had already moved on to Thailand and his mother planned to follow him after Paul’s graduate ceremony. Paul was introduced to me by Matthias from the German school. The two had met through a common friend, whom Paul happened to bump into on a regular basis in different bars or nightclubs. They became friends and founded a band. Paul was interested in my research and agreed to meet for an interview at a coffee shop downtown. In August 2011, Paul moved to a German university town and enrolled at a private, English-language university. His grandparents and half-sister also live in Germany, though not in the same area. After the interview in Shanghai, I met Paul once more in person, just after Christmas 2011. We had stayed in touch via Facebook and exchanged phone numbers, planning to meet up in Germany. During our meeting, we discussed his arrival and emplacement in Germany, as well as his future plans. He completed his Bachelor’s degree in 2015.</p>
        <p><bold>Peter</bold> was already eighteen years old when we met. A tall boy with hair that always seemed to cover half his face, he was a student at the German school, in the same grade, but in a different class than the one I was allowed to accompany. However, he and his friend Marco spent a lot of time with the students from “my” class. As part of “the boys,” Peter went out frequently and it was therefore not surprising that we got to know each other during nightlife activities. I first interviewed him with Marco, in May 2011, in a downtown café. For Peter, who was born in northern Germany, the move to Shanghai was his first and only move abroad. When the interview took place, he had lived in the city for almost four years. I met Peter again for an individual interview in June 2012, just a few days before he left for Germany right after his graduation. Peter, who always wore headphones and a beanie, was interested in young German street-wear labels and we sometimes talked about new styles we had discovered. He was also always interested in my research and student life in Germany and liked to discuss German politics.  Peter became an important gatekeeper in my research during my last follow-up stay in June 2012, when he invited me to several activities. At that time, he seemed to have a particularly strong position among “the boys.” After graduation, Peter returned to the city he considers his hometown in Germany and shared a flat with Alex. He obtained a part-time student job, hoping to enroll at the city’s university. We met several times over the first few years after his move back. He finally moved to the same town Bjorn and Charlie live in, and is currently studying to become a teacher.</p>
        <p><bold>Tamara </bold>was twelve years old when I hosted a group discussion with her and two other students (Jacob and Allen) at an international British school. After her first move to China at the age of two, she moved back and forth between China and Singapore—her country that had issued her passport. Tamara was very talkative during the group interview. Unfortunately, I was not able to keep in touch with her.</p>
        <p><bold>Vijay </bold>was fourteen when he, along with Freda and Keith, took part in a group discussion I conducted at a British school. He is from India and had moved to Shanghai six months prior to the interview.</p>
        <p><bold>Xia</bold> is a Chinese national and was seventeen when we first met. Xia had been granted special permission by the Shanghai municipal government to attend the German school. Born in China, Xia moved to Germany with his parents when he was six years old, so his father could begin his doctoral studies. Xia therefore started his school career in Germany. After four years and one move within Germany, his parents decided to return to Shanghai. Although he had studied Chinese writing after school and on the weekends, Xia had difficulties with the local Chinese schools’ entrance tests, because the education system and its ways of testing were unfamiliar to him. His parents therefore applied for a special permit and Xia was allowed to attend the German school. Here, Xia was an academically strong student. However, his fellow students always regarded Xia as different. I conducted an individual interview with him in spring 2011 and, after that, met him on a regular basis at school, where we would occasionally chat. When I asked all under-age students to provide me with their parents’ permission for interviews, I was surprised that Xia thought he could not participate; his parents were of the opinion that he did not fit the definition of students that my research targeted. The main issue was my use of the term “Third Culture Kids.” I had chosen the expression because I knew that the expatriate community was familiar with it and it seemed a shortcut to explain my research agenda on expatriate youth. Xia’s parents, however, did not see their son as such a hybrid “TCK,” but as Chinese. I was glad when my explanation to Xia that the term can be debated and that anyone who was interested could join led his parents to consent. I discussed the politics of cultural identity and intergenerational conflicts around this issue with Xia, who was very self-reflective upon the matter, in our first interview. This conversation showed me the difficulties that can arise for students who have to negotiate between the world at home and the world at school. I conducted a second interview with Xia in June 2012. After graduation, Xia moved to Germany to study engineering.</p>

                <p> Geographer Georg Glasze (2006), for instance, brings the particularities of
                    expatriate housing practices to the fore, describing the role of gated
                    communities among expatriates in Saudi Arabia. Katie Walsh (2006a; 2006b; 2008;
                    2011) focuses on British expatriate identities in Dubai, examining cultural
                    practices of domesticity, intimacy, and consequent articulations of belonging
                    and national identity. Heather Hindman (2009a; 2009b) pays detailed attention to
                    the meaning-laden activity of shopping for expatriate women in Nepal and reveals
                    that behind the shopping for art objects and an interest in cuisine lies the
                    need for easily transferable elements in a world of constant movement. Food and
                    art, unlike language skills and local friendships, “can be utilized as
                    anecdotal parallels in future postings” (Hindman 2009a, 256). The
                    collected objects at the next destination “act as means of transferring
                    knowledge and status between locations” (Hindman 2009b, 676), helping the
                    expatriate women to recreate themselves. Willis and Yeoh (2002; 2005) contribute
                    a comparative angle, writing on British and Singaporean Expatriates in Hong Kong
                    and China based on material from 247 interviews that were conducted between 1997
                    and 2001. They also provide insight into the gendered experiences of privileged
                    migration, a perspective they pursue further in their article on single British
                    migrants in China (Willis and Yeoh 2008).</p>
                <p> James Farrer (2008; 2010; 2011) examines expatriates’ nightlife
                    activities, sexuality, and intermarriage and their relevance to encounters with
                    the “local” in Shanghai. In addition to his emphasis on the
                    interaction with “locals,” Farrer also broadens the view on
                    expatriates themselves by investigating foreigners in Shanghai who stay longer
                    than five years. Foregrounding their narratives of emplacement, he questions the
                    standard “equation of expatriates with highly mobile transnational
                    elites” (2010, 15) and points out the increasing diversity of the
                    expatriate community in social composition.</p>
                <p> In addition to these writings with their particular foci, two complete
                    ethnographies focusing on two distinct expatriate communities have appeared.

                    insights into expatriate communities’ structures and everyday practices.
                    Anne-Meike Fechter’s work particularly concentrates on the boundaries
                    present in expatriate life in Indonesia.</p>

                <p> Tanu’s study reveals that different labels, such as
                    “Indonesian” or “White” – that seem to be linked
                    rather to a native English speaker status and mannerisms than to actual physical
                    appearance (ibid., 230) – are prominent in everyday discussions at school.
                    While for the school administrators “the ideal student is the
                    ‘global citizen’,” many of the students with Asian backgrounds
                    are seen as “add[ing] to the school’s overall sense of visible
                    diversity,” while “fall[ing] short on being
                    ‘international’” (ibid.). Internationalism renders the
                    dominant Western culture invisible, establishing hierarchies of who is or is not
                    “international.” In Tanu’s words: “International schools
                    may be a multicultural bubble, but it is a bubble that is not immune to the
                    dynamics at work in the world outside the school gates” (<xref rid="IDb5bc4392-b6c3-4479-9fc3-b39eb452e11f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID19274198379821739821173198732198">ibid., 231</xref>).</p>

                <p> The Chicago School of Sociology, founded in 1915, laid the groundwork for this
                    field of study in particular with its later monographs in the 1960s and 1970s
                    focusing on specific quarters, districts, and communities within the city
                    (Wildner 1995, 6). Robert Ezra Park, founder of the Chicago School, studied in
                    Berlin under Georg Simmel (Hannerz 1980, 22), whose progressive writings
                    contemplating the living conditions of people in modern cities (Simmel 1903) can
                    be seen as early stepping stones towards an urban anthropology (Wildner 1995,
                    6). Urban anthropology has always been influenced by history, sociology, and
                    geography (Hannerz 1980, 4), in addition to its beginnings in Chicago. Hannerz
                    has argued that the “remarkable pioneering work in urban ethnography
                    carried out there particularly in the 1920s and 1930s” has shown that the
                    boundary between sociology and anthropology can largely be disregarded (1980,
                    16). Only by the 1960s did anthropologists, habitually concerned with rural
                    societies, increasingly turn their attention toward cities, faced with
                    urbanization in their “traditional fields” as well as changes and
                    so-called “urban problems” in their cities at home (ibid., 1).
                    According to Hannerz, it was not until a decade later that the term “Urban
                    Anthropology” emerged (ibid., 2). While early ethnographers focusing on
                    cities investigated particular places within the city, later works in urban
                    anthropology saw the necessity of considering the city as a complete whole with
                    a central function in global society (Wildner 1995, 2).</p>

        <p> Goldstein (2002, 496) argues that, in response to mistrust, some fieldworkers end up
          focusing “on ritual, or politics, or other public domains of social life […]
          finding that, in addition to their accessibility, these are in fact the topics that their
          research consultants would most prefer them to study.” Likewise, one can, on the one
          hand, interpret the relationship between the participating teenagers and me as a trustful
          one in regards to my presence during nightlife and illegal activities. I am sure that, to
          a certain extent, my participation led to acceptance and offered the possibility for
          students to also casually inquire about my own life and to get to know me better. On the
          other hand, it soon became obvious that this invitation and willingness to trust me also
          had something to do with the fact that the youths liked to see their nightlife activities
          take center stage in my work. For them, writing about nightlife was crucial for
          representing their lifestyle; it was how they wanted to be represented. They were also
          eager to talk about nightlife activities during the interviews, while emotional
          difficulties associated with the move to Shanghai were, in contrast, often mentioned in
          passing, not elaborated upon, and seemed to provoke unease and careful wording. In short,
          the depiction of difficulties was rather unpopular. </p>

        <p> These friendships were obviously based on gender, something I had already observed when
          looking at the seating arrangement in the classroom. This was apparently the case in both
          of the eleventh grade classes at the German school I visited. Peter, one of the students,
          once commented on the classroom division during an interview: “Like in prison, women
          and men separate.” Although this division was abandoned by the senior year, gender
          played a crucial role in the expatriate teenagers’ friendships and, consequently, in
          my interactions with them. I often wondered about the implications of my own gender on my
          relationships and my overall research. While I felt that being female was beneficial to my
          more intimate, sometimes friendship-like interactions with the girls, I often experienced
          it as an obstacle (at least in the beginning) when I interacted with the boys. Niobe Way
          (2004, 173) and his research group inquiring adolescent boys’ experiences and
          concepts of friendship, however, found over the course of their project that many boys
          preferred female interviewers.</p>

        <p> In general, the boys’ participation in activities such as alcohol and drug
          consumption and skipping school challenged my position, and occasionally caused me to
          worry. While I decided to accept the situation at hand and not interfere, there were a few
          occasions when I voiced my opinion to the teenagers and ensured that people got home
          safely or not did not get involved in behavior that would be harmful to others. However,
          as I never involved parents or teachers, the relationship of trust remained intact despite
          these interventions, and I continued to trust that students, between their abilities and
          intellects, as well as the rules imposed by their parents, could take care of themselves.
          The rules imposed by parents, such as curfews, differed among students. Occasionally, some
          teenagers stayed at friends’ houses overnight to avoid their own parents’
          strict rules. In general, clubs in Shanghai do not enforce any age-based restrictions on
          club entry or alcohol sales. See Chapter 2 of Part IV on nightlife practices for more

        <p> The Ethics teacher had asked me, after a few days of observation, to participate in or
          help teach his class. I came up with the idea of discussing the topics of
          “identity” and “home” with students. Although the mind map project
          was designed out of the necessity to maintain social access to the Ethics class, it later
          proved very valuable. The teenagers were asked to exchange their ideas about what the
          terms “Identität” (identity) or “Heimat” (home) meant to them
          in written form, working in small groups of three or four. These discussions were
          conducted in silence, with students writing their ideas on two different large sheets of
          paper and commenting on each other’s responses. The eight resulting mind maps
          highlight the students’ self-reflective ways of thinking about moving. The written
          thoughts about “home” in particular proved insightful, and it thus became
          apparent that “home” is a term laden with many associations and emotions for
          these international youths. The issue of “home” and the relevant mind maps are
          discussed in detail in Part III, Chapter 2.</p>

        <p> As Nigel Rapport (2000) points out, although not linking his concept to Giddens,
          narrative is both an individual’s creation of his or her own self and a fieldwork
          technique that provides the space for important stories of the individual’s own self
          to unfold. If we understand the self as “an ‘unfinished project’,
          continually subject to being rewritten,” it is the act of narration that holds it
          together (ibid., 76). “Narrative […] transforms the temporal and spatial
          fragmentariness of our lives, offering coherence: a sense that our lives may be, at every
          moment, at least partially integrated into an ongoing story” (ibid.). The narrative
          form thus “counteracts a sense of fragmentation, contingency, randomness [and]
          dislocation” (ibid.) and acts as a “modus vivendi,” a way of living, for
          “fieldworker and subject of study alike,” as both seek “a place
          cognitively to reside and make sense, a place to continue to be” in a moving world
          (ibid.). I experienced this in many conversations, interviews, and group discussions in
          which I shared such a space with the teenagers, while the informants were constantly aware
          that their narratives were becoming part of my anthropological endeavor and overall
          narrative. Writing this overall narrative in the form of this book also required
          reflection on my authority as author. This means that the decision to write about
          fieldwork situations in the present tense cannot merely be seen as a simple stylistic
          preference. Following the ongoing discussion on the so-called “ethnographic
          present” that began within the context of the writing culture debate of the 1980s
          (for an overview, see Hastrup 1990 and Pink 2009; Pink (2009) particularly comments on the
          implications of the ethnographic present on text-image relations), I understand that
          writing about fieldwork situations in the present tense has been criticized for locating
          the “other” in a different time frame from that of the narrator, consequently
          objectifying the “other.”  However, suggestions to reconceptualize the
          ethnographic present have been put forth by anthropologist Kirsten Hastrup (1990), among
          others. I agree that a reinvention may be useful and see the ethnographic present as a
          form of writing that highlights the continuous process of knowledge production, showing
          that fieldwork and writing are processual, selective, and subjective. I find that the
          present tense can also help the reader to understand the research situation and my
          perspective as a researcher in greater depth. The past tense, in contrast, would have
          communicated temporal differences between “being there” and my writing phase
          more clearly, but at the same time, would have evoked a false finality and authority on
          the insights produced.</p>

        <p> Michael Anderson (1999), who analyzes the experiences of children from bicultural
          marriages in Athens, Greece, illustrates how different and sometimes rivaling cultural
          ideas of child-rearing have to be managed in the home. Based on ethnographic material from
          British-Greek families, Anderson highlights the intra-familial “edges [such as]
          language, the body and certain aspects of social protocol” (ibid., 18) in which
          parents or extended family experience and express their specific Greekness or Britishness
          with respect to their children. Examining the ways those children dealt with differences
          within the family, Anderson concludes that they “generate their own conceptual
          spaces and identities 'in-between' culturally differentiated adult thoughts and actions
          through certain identificatory media and thereby affect not merely a role of cultural
          brokering but hybridized identities in their own right” (ibid. 13).</p>

        <p> In addition to seventeen individual interviews, I held fourteen group discussions with
          thirty-nine different students. Most of the recorded individual interviews were with
          students who had already taken part in a group discussion. Four students only took part in
          individual interviews. Several students were interviewed two or three times, leading to a
          total of thirty-one group and individual interviews with forty-three students. All of

        <p> I transcribed all recorded interviews and group discussions, capturing all fillers,
          sighs, and laughter. While most of the transcripts encompass the complete interview, I
          occasionally summarize passages of my own contributions during the interview. The
          qualitative data analysis program Atlas.ti proved to be a useful tool for sorting,
          structuring, and linking all my textual and visual materials. This software also allowed
          me to code my interview material based on keywords and themes. These codes either reflect
          my research question or are based on trends that emerged from the transcripts. Coding
          categories were not mutually exclusive and passages could be attributed to several themes
          at once. Coding required several close readings of the transcripts. The ﬁeld notes
          captured the interview setting to help me remember my own feelings during the discussion,
          as well as the overall mood or context of the interviews, and to uncover the relevance of
          issues that were only addressed in passing. Chapters and arguments were consequently
          developed around prominent themes and codes in the writing process and interpreted further
          against the backdrop of theories, personal experiences, and the visual materials. My field
          notes, as reflections of my own engagement with Shanghai and my research, and as protocols
          documenting interviews, school days, and specific events in the community, helped me to
          remember the overall setting. Most of these notes are hand-written and I abstained from
          sorting or coding them in Atlas.ti. However, they helped me to reflect upon and interpret
          the interview quotes. The notes also shed light on the subjective practice of fieldwork,
          my own position in the field, and the production of “data.” Simultaneously,
          these notes also provided insight into the students’ everyday lives and their
          attitudes toward my research project.</p>

        <p> The majority of visual material consists of pictures I took as “photo
          protocols” to document the atmosphere in certain places. I also resorted to
          “visual note taking,” whenever writing notes seemed awkward, for instance at
          bars or at the graduation dance. On some of these occasions, taking photos even turned out
          to become “my job.” At the graduation party, students came up and asked me to
          take pictures of them with their friends—the choice of motif thus no longer being
          mine. I directly incorporated some of my digital photography to provide further insights
          into the specific places the students and I moved through. Images of such places invite us
          to contemplate the relevance of the experience of being “there.” Sara Pink
          notes that “photographs were important because the researcher took them when in that
          environment. They invited me not to know first-hand what it was like to contemplate the
          route ahead represented in the photo, but to imagine what it might be like. Importantly it
          led me to consider that the experience of it would be relevant” (Pink 2011, 438).
          The images I chose to display aim to support my research emphasis on the experience of the
          local environment and, at the same time, reflect my own position in the overall field.</p>
        <p> In addition to my own photography, I gained access and the right to use photographs that
          the students themselves produced. This was the case with images taken for a geography
          project where students had documented elements of globalization in Shanghai’s urban
          landscape (see earlier sections on “the girls” for more details). Some
          students also shared their prom pictures with me.</p>
        <p> I also had access to student artworks that were displayed on campus or in yearbooks.
          These images were mostly relevant in triggering conversations with students about the
          production and meanings behind them. One example is Andrea’s work “My time is
          now” (Figure 21), which I discuss in detail in Part IV, Chapter 1.</p>
        <p> Two films produced by students at the German school also found their way into my media
          assemblage. A film by Kressi and one of her friends was made for an awards ceremony in
          Germany. This film seemed more like a PR film for the school and is discussed in more
          detail in Part III, Chapter 3.2 (see Figures 15 and 16). A second film shot by students at
          the German school was shown during dinner at the graduation ball. In contrast to the first
          film, the second film did not highlight the overall school, but showed the group of
          students that graduated. This film contributed further insights into the meaning students
          attribute to the moment of high school graduation as well as farewell rituals (see Part V,
          Chapter 1). </p>
        <p> I also initiated a photo project during my last visit to Shanghai in 2012, for which I
          asked students to send me photos referring to the theme “home in Shanghai.”
          The intention was to gain another perspective on the subjective experiences of home and
          belonging through students’ own visual approaches. Few students responded, and most
          of those who did only did so after they had already left Shanghai. Instead of taking a
          photo specifically for this request, many of them browsed through their pictures and sent
          me one or two images that, for them, best captured the idea of feeling at home in
          Shanghai. These images deal with various themes and provide insights into the
          students’ personal worlds, displaying family members, friends, pets, and locations.
          The fact that some were chosen after the students left Shanghai offered new insights into
          their subjective experiences of moving and longing for a place that was left behind. Two
          images, in which the German girl Mia captured her bedroom in Shanghai before moving
          (Figure 11) and, later, while preparing for the next move (Figure 30), are displayed in
          this ethnography. These images were chosen because they brilliantly illustrate the
          experience of home and moving by showing the physical aspect of these interconnected
          practices.</p>

        <p> My point of view, or in Gupta and Ferguson’s  (1997) words, my
          “location,” is not a stable point of reference either. The
          “Location” as the fieldworker’s standpoint and position in society, as
          for instance German, white, female graduate student, is not something “one
          ascriptively has” but one “works at” (1997, 37). Location is constantly
          shifting: “Rather than a set of labels that pins down one’s identity and
          perspective, location becomes visible here as an ongoing project” (ibid.).</p>

        <p> It is interesting to see how Don’s perception of the compounds differs from that of his
          white friends and how his physical differences, which suggest a different nationality,
          lead to him to experience the city differently. I will expand on this issue in Part IV,
          Chapter 4. It is also noteworthy that Don started the phrase with “as a Chinese,” to then
          correct himself “if you look Chinese.” This comment shows how the international students
          constantly have to negotiate their cultural identities in everyday life; processes that I
          discussed in the introduction and in Part I, Chapter 4.</p>

        <p> The French Concession was a foreign concession within Shanghai from 1849 to 1946. Today,
          it maintains its distinctive character, despite being one of Shanghai’s most central
          districts. It has also become popular among young foreigners; I lived there in 2010 and
          2011, during my research stay. It is interesting that this part of the city, which still
          exhibits colonial traces, represents the flavor of Shanghai to other foreigners, something

        <p>The English word “chilling,” here adapted to German grammar as “chillen,” refers to the

        <p> In a commentary on spatial metaphors and speaking positions, Geraldine Pratt warns
          against the “rhetoric of mobility and detachment from place“ (1992, 241) that increasingly
          informs the metaphors used in contemporary cultural studies literature. This rhetoric
          praises mobility and privileges movement in the production of knowledge. Pratt argues that
          these metaphors run the risk of promoting an understanding of dwelling that focuses solely
          on reactionary ideas or problems, as in some forms of nationalism, for example, and calls
          for understanding dwelling also as “the legitimacy and value of peoples’ struggles to
          create their own places and memories” (Pratt 1992, 243). Pratt emphasizes that this focus
          needs to accompany “the rhetoric of movement that privileges detachment from place” in
          order to “break down a new hierarchy of difference created through the seemingly
          fashionable mobility—dwelling duality” (ibid.).</p>

        <p>Habitus, as described by Bourdieu in “The Forms of Capital,” can be understood as a

          the term simultaneously characterizes the formative relations between individuals and
          their socio-cultural surroundings, as Bourdieu argues in his work Distinction: A Social
          Critique of the Judgment of Taste (1984, 170): “The habitus is not only a structuring
          structure, which organizes practices and the perception of practices, but also a
          structured structure: the principle of division into logical classes which organizes the
          perception of the social world [that] is itself the product of internalization of the

        <p> In the 1980s, George Marcus summarized the research on the elite, whether taking a
          “pluralist view” or the “‘power elite’ view” (1983a, 13), as having “failed to pay
          systematic attention to the cultures and forms of life of those identified as elites”
          (ibid., 25). While, on the one hand, Marcus considered the anthropology of elites suitable
          to fill this lacuna in research, he, on the other hand, regarded the earlier research
          frameworks of contrasting elites to the masses as “the least adequate for empirical
          investigation” (ibid., 13):</p>
        <p>For the ethnographer, relating elites to corporate systems, rather than to specific
          people, requires the ability to define closely observed subjects as elites, not in
          relativistic terms which would be appropriate for small-scale societies, but in reference
          to the total larger system in which they are elites. Thus, selection of elites as
          ethnographic subjects presupposes considerable prior knowledge or guesswork about the
          nature of the larger system in which it is meaningful to label them as elites (Marcus
          1983a, 13).</p>
        <p>Marcus also saw the term “in its manifestation as an Anglo-Amercian research tradition”
          (1983a, 25) as an “uncertain guide” regarding how it could be appropriately applied to
          research on elites in a range of different societies. Almost two decades later, Shore and
          Nugent (2002) edited another volume on the study of the elite in anthropology, which
          connects similar issues and questions, as in the anthology edited by Marcus (1983b). Shore
          and Nugent’s volume further stresses the anthropology of the elite as “an exercise in
          political reflexivity” since it obliges anthropologists to position themselves “more
          self-consciously in relation to the wider system of power and hierarchy within which
          anthropological knowledge is constructed” (Shore 2002, 2). </p>

            ich Medizin studiere, [soll ich] eine Praxis aufmachen. Mit Kind. Halt so

            &lt;L&gt; Mal ein Medizinstudium, eben mal eine Praxis aufmachen!</italic> Charlie:
            <italic>Nee. Aber meine Eltern meinten halten, so ja, Studium wäre voll entspannt und
            so. Aber ich glaub das ist auch, weil sie vorher in China waren. Und in Deutschland
            Studium ist bestimmt entspannter als in China Schule. […] Aber meine Eltern sind
            eigentlich ganz locker. Also dafür, dass sie chinesische Eltern sind. &lt;L&gt; Weil sie
            lassen mich auch feiern gehen abends. Also sie mögen es nicht so gerne, wenn ich so oft
            gehe. Aber ab und zu ist okay. Und sonst unterstützen die das auch wenn ich was mit
            Freunden mache und so was. Nur jetzt meinen sie halt Abiturlernen ist das Wichtigste.
            Aber es gibt halt auch so Eltern, die das gar nicht erlauben.</italic>

        <p> For urban Chinese youths’ perspectives on the role of academic success in developing
          personal “quality” (suzhi), see Vanessa L. Fong (Fong 2007). Drawing from interviews and
          thirty-two months of participant observation conducted in schools in Dalian between 1997
          and 2006, Fong examines how urban Chinese “only-children” negotiate the popular idea of
          “quality” by stressing the importance of aspects of quality—such as morality,
          cosmopolitanism, or academic achievement—that favored their own strengths.</p>

                        Wenn man dann einfach getrennt wird von denen. Dann war ich doch nicht mehr

                <p>German original: Andrea: <italic>Und […] ich hab mich da so ein bisschen
                        von amerikanischen Schulen inspirieren lassen. Die ja immer sehr auf ihre
                        Gemeinschaft und so, und auf ihr Schulleben anspielen, gerne auch –
                        wie so Werbeaktionen praktisch. Das ist ja voll peinlich zum Teil. Ich hab
                        mir dann gedacht, das käme an unserer Schule sehr gut [...] an. Also es
                        war ja dann [so], also bei den Lehrern und so. Also ich bin dann so
                        vorgegangen, okay, jetzt mach ich mal ‘nen Projekt, muss ja jetzt
                        nicht, weil ich kann nicht so gut fotografieren […], muss ja jetzt
                        nicht fotografisch überzeugen. Aber es kann ja mal so ein bisschen
                        anspielen, dass wir eine Schule sind, “geborgen und gemeinsam
                        gewachsen” [Anspielung an Schulslogan] und so was. Weil das ja nicht
                        so deutsch ist so was, sich da so selbst zu präsentieren […]
                        dachte ich mir auch, dass das entsprechend von meinen Lehrern aufgegriffen
                        werden könnte. Und ehm &lt;L&gt;, war ja schon sehr cheesy alles. Und
                        hab dann im Internet gegoogelt, was es denn so für Zitate gibt, denn
                        ich wollte gern so was mit Text und Fotografie machen. Und ja dann kam da
                        “My time is now,” was ja voll perfekt ist. Und so ein bisschen
                        sehr kitschig. Und hab dann halt dieses T-Shirt [gemacht], ich dachte mir:
                        “Ja, okay, dann können die das tragen oder halten.” [...].
                        Und dieses Schild. Und dann bin ich in der Schule rum und hab ein paar
                        Schüler gefragt ob die mir da helfen. Dann hab ich meine Freundinnen
                        gefragt ob die mir da helfen, weil ich bin da nicht gerne so: “Hallo,
                        meine Name ist Andrea! Wir machen &lt;x&gt;.” Hab dann natürlich,
                        ehm, mir Mühe gegeben ein paar Franzosen reinzubekommen, weil das
                        spielt ja noch mehr diese soziale Integration an. Die bei uns ja in
                        Deutschland an jeder Schule total beliebt ist.</italic>

                <p> Valentine (2003) considers these self-made rituals and the perspective of youths
                    themselves as central for scholars who want to understand the transitional
                    process into adulthood: “In this sense perhaps rather than applying adult
                    measures of the extent to which children have achieved ‘adulthood’
                    we need to pay more attention to the different ways young people themselves
                    define and understand this boundary crossing. As such we also need to question
                    to what extent social categories such as gender, race, class and sexuality
                    actually have any meaning for young people as they grow up” (Valentine

                    adolescence were particularly influential and involved in her informants’
                    identity negotiations: “This is especially prevalent during adolescence, a
                    time when social affiliations and identifications are negotiated, and when a
                    clear sense of belonging to a specific group becomes especially important. Even
                    if reflections about belonging remain important as people grow older, the
                    emphasis on affiliations to particular peer groups and the need to be recognised

                <p>For a positive reading of such cross-ethnic sexual contacts, see cultural
                    historian Mica Nava’s reading of British women’s attraction to
                    foreign men in the early 20th century. Focusing on commercial culture because of
                    its responsiveness to the preferences of female customers, Nava demonstrates
                    British women’s interest in foreign culture, men, and cosmopolitanism.
                    “Unlike the exoticizing narratives identified by critics of
                    orientalism—in which ‘other’ women are cast as objects of
                    sexual desire and the oriental landscape is represented rhetorically as erotic
                    female—in the cosmopolitanism of the commercial and entertainment spheres,
                    women appropriate the narratives of difference for themselves in contrary and
                    even polemical ways“ . Nava convincingly argues that these women’s
                    “flirtation with difference, with the outside, the elsewhere, the
                    other” (ibid., 94) underlies an identification with the black male’s
                    position vis-à-vis the dominant white man. Her emphasis on the production
                    of everyday cosmopolitanism, rather than racism, in the first decades of the
                    20th century, “however politically imperative” (ibid., 85),
                    demonstrates the complexity and the relevance of gender-specific experiences and
                    practices of vernacular cosmopolitanism.</p>

                    (2007) article “Partying as Everyday Life: Investigations of
                    Teenagers’ Leisure Life,” which explores the meaning behind such
                    practices among Danish youths. By conceptualizing partying and alcohol
                    consumption as a rite of passage on the one hand, but situating these events in
                    everyday life on the other, their analysis suggests that, at such house parties,
                    the collective consumption of alcohol is a means to transform the parents’
                    living room into an appropriate space for partying. Using both qualitative and
                    quantitative material, the authors demonstrate that drinking alcohol
                    collectively does not only mean experimenting with intoxication, but
                    “symbolises commitment to both the party and to the specific group of
                    friends” (ibid., 517). Like the nightlife activities of the teenage
                    subjects in this study, partying at home is, for Danish youths, also a way of
                    reaffirming friendships. Therefore, Demant and Østergaard argue that
                    partying is an integral part the everyday lives of adolescents. It helps them to
                    extend their networks of friends, as well as to continuously reaffirm existing
                    mutual attachments.</p>

                <p>(2005), in writing about experiences of (re)migration of expatriate youths from
                    Africa to Germany, reflects upon the effects that the experience of whiteness
                    can have for children. She describes the link between whiteness and superiority
                    as follows:</p>
                <p>The message the majority of white children growing up in "black" Africa get is
                    that being white goes along with being rich and superior. While blacks may also
                    (be)come rich and advance economically for different reasons, being rich appears
                    to be an innate and natural feature of being white, a feature of social class,
                    which in most cases goes along with a feeling of cultural superiority. Whereas
                    white parents in most cases have experienced that being white does not have such
                    implications everywhere, many white children lack this experience
                    altogether—and many of their parents prefer forgetting it while in Africa
                    (Knörr 2005, 61).</p>

                        Meistens sind es dann Studenten, weil die haben dann ja Zeit zum Feiern. Und
                        so. Und dann fühl ich mich schon angenommen. Aber ich fühl mich
                        gleichzeitig auch ein bisschen als Ausländerin. Weil die mich als
                        Ausländerin sehen.</italic>

                        das auch strenger ist einfach. Hier gilt auch noch die Todesstrafe. Das

                        die Polizei angeht, da mache ich immer einen großen Bogen drum. Ich
                        weiß nicht. Vor denen hab ich, vor denen fürchte ich mich
                        irgendwie. Das ist in Prag wieder anders. Weil es dort nämlich so
                        gefährlich ist. Ich weiß nicht, da fühl ich mich bei der

                        Ausländer hat man hier meistens eh die Arschkarte wenn man was macht.
                        Vor allem. Hier, ein Mitarbeiter von meinem Vater, der hat einen Unfall
                        gebaut. Der ist in den Knast gewandert, obwohl es noch nicht mal sein Fehler
                        war. Die Chinesen, die haben sich alle zusammen getan. Haben irgendwas
                        abgemacht, besprochen und sind dann auf ihn losgegangen. Und haben ihm
                        gesagt: “Das ist deine Schuld.” Und die Polizei war dann
                        natürlich auch gegen ihn. […] </italic>Interviewer: <italic>Also,

                        Karina: Ja, das ist heftig. Wenn man weiß wie das hier vor sich
                        läuft, vor allem. Todesstrafe? Das ist auch ziemlich heftig. Die werden
                        hier immer noch erschossen im Knast. Wenn ich mir jetzt Ai Weiwei angucke.
                        Der ist spurlos verschwunden. Niemand wusste wo er ist.</italic>

                        leben und die nächste Generation und so. Und die sollten sich dann
                        eigentlich integrieren. Anfangen Deutsch zu reden und so weiter. Aber hier.
                        Die Ausländer lernen Chinesisch um ein bisschen kommunizieren zu
                        können. Aber werden für immer Ausländer bleiben. Die
                        integrieren sich nicht. Und das liegt auch daran, dass sie bald wieder
                        gehen. Und weil du hier auch einfach als Ausländer durchkommst. Und,
                        ehm, in deinem Beruf auch mit Englisch durchkommst. Wahrscheinlich gerade
                        weil du Deutscher bist. Hier bist bei der deutschen Firma. Da ist es nicht

            zurück und hab dann innerhalb von einer Woche eine Wohnung gesucht. Dann kamen

            <italic>Voll reingeworfen, voll reingestürzt. Ehm, und ich glaub am Anfang war das

            halt ... [...] Also, die erste Woche, das weiß ich noch, also ich hatte
            tagsüber megaviel zu tun. Das war voll schön. Ich hab ganz viele neue Leute

            bin aus Shanghai.” Also zum Beispiel […] meine Mitbewohnerin, das war

            auch so unvorstellbar ist also. Weil es ja auch nicht richtig chinesisch ist, weil das
            war ja so eine komische Gesellschaft in der wir in Shanghai gelebt haben. Das habe ich
            auch immer versucht zu beschreiben wie es war. Weil die einfach nicht verstehen wie es

          konstanter Wechsel, und ehm, dadurch wusste man irgendwie, wie es geht,

            konkrete Situationen denken, wo wir das gemacht haben.</italic> Mia: <italic>Genau, und

            Fall ein sehr starker Bezug da. […] Ich kuck mir halt auch wirklich sehr oft alte
            Bilder an, aber gleichzeitig deprimiert mich das auch irgendwie so ein bisschen. Ich
            weiß nicht, das ist immer so, es ist halt einfach Heimweh dann […]. Ich denke
            viel darüber nach und ich hab ja auch viele Sachen in meinem Zimmer die mich
            irgendwie daran erinnern […]. Wenn man Tee trinkt, trinkt man halt aus so
            ’ner Shanghai Starbucks-Tasse. […] Also so ein Bezug ist auf jeden Fall
            immer da, also wirklich auch jeden Tag. […] Aber natürlich ist es mal mehr,
            mal weniger. Aber ehm, zum Beispiel auch wenn man dann von Freunden die da noch wohnen,
            wenn die dann Fotos posten, dann ist man immer so: “Aah, wie schön,”
            und das kuck ich mir dann auch wirklich gern an. Oder von Leuten die ich dann nicht
            kenne, sondern nur um zwei Ecken.</italic> Interviewer: <italic>Ja.</italic> Mia:
            <italic>Wenn du dann irgendwie auf Instagram denen folgen kannst, und dann siehst du,
            “Ach was haben die nicht wieder für ein schönes Foto von der Skyline
