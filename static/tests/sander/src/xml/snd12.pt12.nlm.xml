      <title>Acknowledgements</title>
      <p>There are many people I would like to thank for supporting my research on expatriate youths and for helping me to write this book. I want to acknowledge the academic and financial support of the Cluster of Excellence “Asia and Europe in a Global Context: Shifting Asymmetries in Cultural Flows” at Heidelberg University, Germany, that helped me transform a dissertation idea into an academic endeavor. I am grateful for the debates I have had with many of the Cluster’s members and the advice and critiques they gave me throughout the years. I especially want to thank my two advisors, Christiane Brosius and Barbara Mittler, for their guidance. I also want to thank all those who encouraged me to rework my dissertation into this book: the anonymous reviewer whose valuable comments helped to sharpen my arguments, and particularly Andrea Hacker, who guided me through the rewriting process. Thanks also go to Andrea’s team, especially to Elizabeth Corrao, for her thorough language editing.</p>
      
      
          <p> I could not have finished this book without my family—especially my wonderful parents, Traudel and Henning Sander, my partner Benjamin, and my friends—“my girls”—Annika, Franziska, and Tanja. To my friend in Shanghai, Yanni Shen, who never tired of explaining and translating, thank you. </p>
        
      
      
      
          <p> I am very grateful for the crucial support of school principals and teachers who were interested in my research. The largest debt of all, however, is owed to all the students in Shanghai who, along with their families, shared their stories and time with me, and especially to those whose words, ideas, and actions appear in this ethnography and made it what I wanted it to be: a book that focuses on the voices and perspectives of the teenagers themselves. Thank you for letting me into your lives despite my having an agenda and for patiently waiting for the outcome of our joint endeavor.</p>
