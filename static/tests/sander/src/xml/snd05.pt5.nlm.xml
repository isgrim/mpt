      <title>Part V: Moving On</title>
      <p>The final part of this ethnography, &#8220;Moving On,&#8221; returns to the expatriate
        youths&#8217; experience of Shanghai as a transient space. The first chapter centers on the
        students from the German school and analyzes their ways of managing the imminent move away
        from Shanghai. It focuses on their graduation and its related festivities as a means to say
        goodbye to Shanghai and examines their plans, anticipations, and anxieties regarding their
        next stop: university. The second chapter concludes this work by revisiting the German
        students two years after they have left Shanghai and returned to Germany, focusing on their
        new beginnings there. It presents the students&#8217; perspectives and reflections on
        transnational mobility and explores how their experience of &#8220;returning&#8221; is
        linked to the overall findings of this ethnography. </p>

          Peter: Well, it&#8217;s strange because I don&#8217;t even know anymore what it is
                like to live in Germany. And you have, as I said, these stable points that you are
                focused on and that you rely on. And you have gotten this routine. And you have to
                rebuild all this again. Because every human being needs some kind of routine, I
                think. And I also need that. &lt;L&gt; And now this is&#160;&#8230; Because I live
                in a hotel and I don&#8217;t have my things, and I don&#8217;t have my things
                anywhere else &lt;L&gt;              that means that, right now, I&#8217;m in the middle of
                nowhere.

        </p>
        <p>After days of packing, Peter describes his situation as being &#8220;in the middle of
          nowhere.&#8221; Peter&#8217;s belongings are now in a container that will be shipped to
          Germany, and he and his family have moved into a hotel, where they will stay for the
          remainder of their time in Shanghai. Prior to moving out of his family&#8217;s home,
          Peter&#8217;s room probably looked similar to that of Mia (Figure 30) when she prepared
          for her move to Germany. Interestingly, she sent this image to me paired with a picture of
          her room as it looked when she lived in it (see Figure 11, in Part III, Chapter 2.2) as a
          response to my question of what &#8220;home&#8221; (in Shanghai) meant to her. Evidently,
          for Mia, home meant both her room in Shanghai and the routine of packing and leaving it
          behind. This transitory experience is shared by all students featured in this ethnography.
          Their complex notion of home, as illustrated by Mia&#8217;s pictures, has been succinctly
          conceptualized by Sara Ahmed, Claudia Casta&#241;eda, Anne-Marie Fortier, and Mimi
          Scheller&#8217;s (<xref rid="IDa1af01c3-ebc3-4b7f-8c0d-b0edeb29f719" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3cf5abab-1020-4cd1-b10e-b6ccf793625d">2003</xref>) idea of
          &#8220;uprootings/regroundings,&#8221; which allows one to consider home and migration to
          be not mutually exclusive. I have already discussed the issue of home-making or
          &#8220;regrounding&#8221; in Part III, Chapter 2, and throughout this ethnography, but
          this final chapter is concerned with the other, concomitant aspect,
          &#8220;uprooting,&#8221; and how the students experienced the move away from Shanghai.</p>
        <p>For the majority of expatriate youths, graduation from school coincides with leaving
          China. While some of the teenagers&#8217; families stay in Shanghai, others only wait for
          their children to complete school before moving on. Consequently, for some students, even
          their place of return&#8212;the family home&#8212;shifts and, as a result, will make
          future visits to Shanghai impossible or difficult. Therefore, in comparison to youths
          whose parents remain in a more or less stable location, graduation is also a closing
          ceremony for, as Olivia from Belgium puts it, the &#8220;Shanghai-chapter&#8221; of their
          lives.</p>
        <p>I returned to Shanghai for two weeks in May and June of 2012, to observe the students
          from the German school during this period of change. It was also my final visit to
          Shanghai, and thus my own farewell: to the city, to my friends, and to &#8220;my
          field,&#8221; which was slowly dissolving since the majority of the actors that inform my
          study were about to move on. During this very intense fortnight, the students and I bonded
          over the common theme of saying goodbye and having to face the question &#8220;What
          next?&#8221;</p>
        <p>The morning after my arrival in Shanghai, I visit the German school to find some of the
          students gathered for their final oral exams. They are nervously going through their
          notes, rehearsing topics with each other, explaining matters that might somehow be related
          to their exam topics, and trying to calm each other down at the same time. This cycle
          repeats itself the following day, when the other half of the students sit their exams. I
          am happy to see all of them again and to catch up on the latest news, especially on their
          plans for the coming days: exams, the announcement of the final results, parties, dinners,
          club visits, the commencement ceremony and festivities, the much-anticipated graduation
          ball, the ball&#8217;s after-party, and a farewell barbecue at &#8220;the shop.&#8221; We
          go on final shopping tours at the fabric and glass markets and simply hang out at the
          students&#8217; homes. In-between observing and occasionally participating in these joyful
          events, I meet ten students for individual, hour-long follow-up interviews to discuss
          their future plans, the decision-making process that led to moving away, their feelings
          about leaving Shanghai and finishing school, as well as their anticipation and any anxiety
          they have about entering university. These matters are presented in detail in the
          following three subsections.</p>


        <sec>
          <title>1.1. Leaving Shanghai</title>
          <p>Andrea and I are sitting outside, on the narrow pavement in front of the same caf&#233;
            where we met for our first interview, just around the corner from her parents&#8217;
            apartment. It is our third interview and, by now, she knows the procedure. The street
            noise level occasionally requires us to shout at each other, but we enjoy our ginger
            lemon tea nonetheless. We start talking about the stressful exam period, the
            celebrations surrounding graduation, and her plans for the summer and beyond. When I
            inquire how she feels about leaving Shanghai, it is apparent that she is still sorting
            out her thoughts and emotions about moving.</p>
          <p>

              <speaker>Andrea</speaker>
              <p>It&#8217;s okay. I mean, it&#8217;s just normal that you move somewhere else for
                your studies, that you somehow move on. And I&#8217;ve been here for seven years
                now.</p>

              that&#160;&#8230; Well, yes, I will miss it. Very much. I will also cry, probably,

          <p>Andrea is still trying to forge her narrative of moving on&#8212;caught between the
            normality of moving away from home for college and her sadness about leaving Shanghai,
            possibly for good. </p>
          <p>Mia expresses similar feelings about saying goodbye to Shangahi when she and I meet to
            discuss her upcoming departure. We sit on her bed, drinking water, in contemplative
            silence&#8212;quite unlike the street noise in the background during my conversation
            with Andrea. Eventually Mia formulates her feelings:</p>
          <p>

              total, and everywhere else I&#8217;ve only spent two or three years. And that&#8217;s
              why this is really my home. It is&#160;&#8230; Here, I know my way around best, I know
              the people; the people know me. Here, even though I only speak a little Chinese, I
              manage. [&#8230;] Yes, when I walk through the city, I know where I am, I know how to
              get where I want to go. [&#8230;] Even if you&#8217;ve been here for a long time, it
              never gets boring. [&#8230;] And sure, on the one hand, I&#8217;m also looking
              [forward to new things.] On the other hand, nevertheless, I could stay. I
              wouldn&#8217;t have a problem with that. [&#8230;] Actually, I don&#8217;t want to
              leave.</italic>

          </p>
          <p>Mia has mixed feelings about the imminent changes. Leaving Shanghai means leaving the
            familiar behind. For Andrea and Mia, there will be no family home in Shanghai to return
            to during university breaks, nor for Olivia, who summarizes her sentiments about leaving
            in an interview at the French caf&#233; close to her school:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s6">
              <speaker>Olivia</speaker>
              <p><italic>Well, the school in Shanghai is the one I went to the longest, ever.
              That&#8217;s why I find it hard. Because I have so many memories, especially because
              I&#8217;ve spent my youth here. That&#8217;s what you always like to remember. Yes,
              good friends, first love, bla bla bla&#8212;all that existed. Yes, I will have a lot
              of memories here. And it is difficult to suddenly&#160;&#8230; I mean, I can&#8217;t
                decide upon leaving now, I have to [leave]. My dad has to move because of work.
                That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t really have a choice. And, well, the farewell is
                difficult for me.</italic>

          </p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Interestingly, even after graduation, Olivia feels she has no choice of staying on in
            Shanghai and decides to move to Belgium with her family. Some students&#8217; families,
            such as Antonia&#8217;s, Xia&#8217;s, Bjorn&#8217;s, Charlie&#8217;s, and Kressi&#8217;s
            will stay in Shanghai. For some students, as in Giovanni&#8217;s case, one parent will
            stay for work and the other will return &#8220;home&#8221; with the younger siblings,
            but for the students whose families are about to leave Shanghai altogether, graduation
            is not only a goodbye to their peers and the school, but also to their house and the
            city. The possibility of returning for visits is therefore rather uncertain.</p>

              <p><italic>I have no idea when I will come back here. And I know that, by then, everything
                will have changed anyway. Well, I hope that I will make it [back] some time in the

          <title>1.2. Celebrating twice: graduation and goodbyes</title>
          <p>The students expend many resources and efforts on shaping their final weeks in Shanghai
            and their final days at school. Graduation, for them, involves preparing several events
            and memorabilia. The major event is the graduation ball, which the students
            traditionally organize themselves. Preparations include finding ways to fund the event,
            choosing and renting a suitable venue, organizing a caterer and decorations, and
            creating the program for the evening. Furthermore, the class is busy writing, designing,
            and getting their &#8220;Abibuch&#8221; (a special graduation yearbook) printed, as well
            as preparing an after-party, which will take place at another downtown location, after
            the formal ball. The 31 students estimate that they spend about RMB 300,000
            (&#8364;33,000) on these celebrations. Part of this sizable amount comes from ticket
            sales for the ball, which cost RMB 400 (&#8364;44) each, yearbooks, which cost RMB 100
            (&#8364;11) each, and fundraising activities, such as bake sales, that took place at the
            school during the last term. Several foreign companies also sponsored the event for a
            sum amounting to around RMB 160,000 (&#8364;17,600). The celebratory events like the
            ball will take place in addition to the official commencement ceremony that is organized
            by and will be held at the school. The students shape this event to some extent, too,
            since they contribute a few musical performances and a student speech. </p>
          <p>The importance of this official ceremony, which values students&#8217; achievements and
            celebrates their graduation, becomes apparent in Mia&#8217;s anticipation a few days
            prior to the event:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s8">
              <speaker> Mia</speaker>
              <p><italic>I am really looking forward to it. I am sure it will be really beautiful. I
              think I will be really sad. When you just notice that, well, school is over now.
              Really! If you think back... It is the only thing you remember! The time before school
              [...] well, I personally don&#8217;t recall that anymore. And even if you were in
                pre-school before and in Kindergarten before that, you had something every day. And
                the time before that&#8212;you really can&#8217;t remember! That&#8217;s why. Really
                strange, I think. Really weird.</italic>

          </p>
          <p>Mia ponders the school routine, and the significance of losing something that has
            accompanied her throughout her life. The end of this period is met with anticipation and
            joy, as well as sadness. However, it is not only the end of school, but also the end of
            their time in Shanghai that the expatriate community celebrates with these ritual
            festivities.</p>
          <p>Graduation ceremonies are rites of passage which, for the students in Shanghai, are
            part of a larger farewell ceremony. According to ethnographer Arnold van Gennep ([<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe635178d-5b7b-431a-8568-c89b38b9ccde">1960</xref>] 1992, 11), who introduced the
            notion of important, life-changing rituals as &#8220;rites of passage&#8221; with the
            general aim of insuring a &#8220;change of condition or a passage from one
            magico-religious or secular group to another,&#8221; such processes undergo three
            different phases: the preliminal or separation phase, the liminal or transitional phase,
            and the postliminal or incorporation phase. Van Gennep, however, noted that not all
            rituals consist of all phases and that it is impossible to &#8220;achieve as rigid a
            classification as the botanists have&#8221; (ibid.). </p>
          <p>The commencement ceremony that I attended at the German school can be seen as an
            essential element of the first part of these rites of passage&#8212;the separation
            phase, as well as of a process of the students&#8217; change in status from high school
            to university student, and an opening to the transitional phase&#8212;a phase that is
            celebrated after the graduation ceremony at the graduation dance and the students&#8217;
            after-party. Because the commencement ceremony was undertaken in a routine way that
            I&#8212;and seemingly everyone else attending&#8212;was familiar with and had
            anticipated, I will not fully analyze that ritual here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e209">7</xref> Neither will I focus on a
        theoretical discussion of the graduation ball or the after-party. Instead, in the passages
        which follow, I will illustrate the overall mood of the festivities I attended, as well as
        the thoughts of the students and the school community they are a part of, to further
        underline the challenges, emotions, and possibilities this moment of leaving Shanghai holds
        for expatriate youths. Nevertheless, Van Gennep&#8217;s notion of the rites of passage helps us to understand
            the importance of such festivities in guiding students&#8217; transition from high
            school to university, and from Shanghai to elsewhere. </p>
          <sec>
            <title>The commencement ceremony</title>
            <p>It is the day of commencement and I am sitting next to Bjorn&#8217;s brother and the
              rest of his family. The soon-to-be graduates are seated in neat rows of chairs on both
              sides of a stage. They are attired for the occasion: the girls in dresses, the boys in
              suits. Equipped with a camera and my field notebook, I wait among the parents,
              siblings, and students&#8217; friends, for the event to start. We all read the small
              program, which helpers from the school have distributed on the long rows of mats that
              have been used to convert the steps in the piazza into seats. The evening begins with
              music and a welcome by the school principal. A small group of students from the
              elementary school leads us through the evening; their announcements repeatedly amuse
              the audience. The school&#8217;s musical stars, various prize winners, play and sing
              between the different speeches. The German consul general talks about the high level
              of the exams, about the opportunities and challenges of being an expat, and cites the
              current federal president of Germany, Joachim Gauck, who calls for commitment to
              society. A representative for the German industry and commerce in Shanghai follows
              with a humorous but also political speech and&#8212;probably with an eye on his
              preceding speaker&#8212;thanks the German ministry of foreign affairs, hereby
              stressing the importance of their financial support, which is always contested. The
              two head teachers of the graduating class give a speech that evokes much laughter and
              is accompanied by photos of all the students on class outings. </p>
            <p>Then, after a musical intermission, the school principal gives his full speech before
              the diplomas are handed out. Starting with political explanations and concerns about
              changes and lessened interest from the German government in financing German schools
              abroad, the principal appeals to parents and German companies to make their needs of
              this support heard. After this political digression, he announces the average grades
              and is proud of the results that are, as he emphasizes, above the German average. He
              then recounts various school events (trips, arts, and sporting events) to stress how
              important it is to be involved in such social activities, in addition to earning good
              grades. Finally, he cites Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who, according to him, said that
              &#8220;parents should give roots and wings to children&#8221; (Wurzeln und Fl&#252;gel
              soll man den Kindern mitgeben). He elaborates on the relations students have to
              different places and how many will move to Germany, Switzerland, or wherever their
              roots are. However, he declares &#8220;one part of your roots is also our
              school&#8221; (aber ein Teil eurer Wurzeln ist auch unsere Schule), naming a few
              students who have been in Shanghai since kindergarten. He then turns to the second
              part of Goethe&#8217;s suggestion for educating children&#8212;the wings:</p>
            <p>
              <disp-quote id="IQ1">
                <p>Your wings are&#8212;not only because of all the miles that you have already
                  travelled up in the air&#8212;much stronger and more flexible than those of your
              future classmates at university. They will carry you. You will realize: you, as the
              graduates of a German school abroad [&#8230;], are special. This should not be a
              reason to become arrogant&#8212;and you aren&#8217;t. Public-spirited, cool, and nice
              young people exist everywhere. You will nonetheless attract attention. Because the
              experiences one brings along, the things you know and are familiar with, stick to you
              like a second skin. And something else is sticking to you that is different to most
              other youths&#8212;namely, a certain familiarity with the world, a familiarity with
              things that are different and foreign to others. Due to your experiences in the world,
              you are in some respects more independent, flexible, and open and therefore you will
              see and grasp more opportunities. However, others also have special expectations of
              you. I am sure&#8212;we are sure&#8212;you will be able to meet these. We are sure you
              will fly.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e226">8</xref>

            <p>This sentiment, which I have tried to reconstruct here from my frenetically-scribbled
              notes, marks the end of the principal&#8217;s speech and is met with enthusiastic
              applause. Interestingly, it mirrors the narrative of privilege and pressure that I
              came across in students&#8217; descriptions of international schooling that was
              highlighted in Part III, Chapter 3.4.</p>
            <p>After the school principal&#8217;s speech&#8212;marking the separation phase of the
              ritual (Van Gennep [<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3f941d0d-f17e-4287-8157-ded8e19cb70e">1960</xref>] 1992)&#8212;the diplomas
              are handed out to all the students in alphabetical order. Applause greets the students
              when their names are called and as they step out onto the stage, receiving handshakes,
              diplomas, gifts, and a photo. After the diplomas are distributed, a few parents gather
              on stage to sing a song (not as perfectly as their children) and, finally, three
              female students&#8212;Mia and Antonia among them&#8212;give the last speech of the
              evening.</p>
            <p>The three girls first start recalling their last years as students. In a humorous
              way, they describe conflicts and debates, as well as positive memories. One after the
              other, their classmates step onto the stage, according to their arrival time in
              Shanghai, to create a timeline which ranges from kindergarten until 2010, only two
              years prior. After sharing these memories, the students&#8217; speech culminates in
              thanking parents, teachers, siblings, the school principal, and the technician
              responsible that evening. &#8220;We are all only here because of our parents and, at
              this point, we want to say thank you for that.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e237">9</xref> This line is met
          with laughter, applause, and cheers from the audience, which consists primarily of family
          members. This response in particular shows how important this statement is for many
          parents. Their children&#8217;s
              acknowledgment of the beneficial aspects of their experience in Shanghai may alleviate
              any remaining feelings of anger or guilt that the move initially prompted (see Part
              II). As they continue with their speech, the graduates combine a farewell to their
              high school days with a farewell to Shanghai. Contemplating the uncertainties of the
              future and the difficulties of choosing a career path, they end on a cheerful note,
              which is followed by much applause: &#8220;But one thing we do understand: Namely,
              what we have to celebrate. To have been a student yesterday, to be almost an adult
              tomorrow, but especially that today we are young.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e243">10</xref>
            </p>
            <p>This last line of the girls&#8217; address can be seen as a transition into what Van
              Gennep ([<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4e7bcfd5-7b77-4db0-a7fe-f3ac4d1a6d87">1960</xref>]1992) conceptualized as the
              second phase of a rite of passage&#8212;the liminal or transition phase. Victor
              Turner, who continued developing and illustrating Van Gennep&#8217;s notion of
              liminality in rite-of-passage processes, describes the liminal phase as a condition
              where people &#8220;slip through the network of classification&#8221; and are
              &#8220;betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom,
              convention, and ceremonial&#8221; ([<xref rid="ID6190d70c-8532-4716-a663-821f897058cf" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e91d05e-e88d-435c-a379-bbe31b5d3e63">1969</xref>]2008, 95).
              Likewise, as the speech given by the three girls indicates, being young is understood
              as both being free from the obligations of high school as well as of those of
              adulthood. &#8220;Young&#8221; here means celebrating without having greater
              responsibilities. The last line is a call for the start of these celebrations, now
              that the youths have their diplomas in hand. Based on Van Gennep&#8217;s ([<xref rid="IDd504bc0a-df62-40da-b4af-e83b666220c1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa1aa87d4-905b-4f28-8a09-e1659d3996b5">1960</xref>]1992) and Victor
              Turner&#8217;s ([<xref rid="ID6190d70c-8532-4716-a663-821f897058cf" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf65c6a08-4050-4165-b3f5-bd5deb93e029">1969</xref>]2008) understanding of
              liminality in the ritual process, social anthropologist Allan Sande (2002) describes
              this phase of partying among recent graduates in Norway as a phase that allows youths
              to behave in ways that are against the cultural norm and that break moral rules.
              Sande, who particularly illustrates the role of alcohol and intoxication in Norwegian
              graduation celebrations, suggests that the youths become detached from society during
              that time, to then be ascribed adult status once this liminal phase is over. </p>
            <p>Following the graduation ceremony, a dinner is hosted for everyone at the school.
              After eating at the buffet and conversing with parents, taking photos, and receiving
              congratulations, the students leave for Mural. This is the first unofficial party that
              everyone joins, but it is also a time for reminiscing and bidding farewell to their
              favorite party location. Siblings and friends who used to live in Shanghai and, like
              me, came from Germany to be part of the celebrations, join in. Parents and teachers
              are not part of this club visit. However, they participate to an extent in the
              graduation ball and after party that take place the following day.</p>

            <title>The graduation ball and after-party</title>
            <p>The next day, I meet some of &#8220;the girls&#8221; at noon at a hairdresser located
              in the same compound where Olivia lives. Olivia, Charlie, and Mia have appointments to
              get their hair done for the graduation ball. I take photos and watch them get styled.
              Back at Olivia&#8217;s house, the three girls and I put on make-up and slip into our
              dresses. Mascara and eye shadow are passed around as we all get excited about the
              upcoming evening. Olivia&#8217;s parents are also there and are very supportive. In
              the late afternoon, their driver takes us to the event location on the South Bund. We
              have to get there early, because the students have one more practice for a dance
              choreography they will be performing that evening. I watch them rehearse, scribble a
              few notes in my diary, and take photos. By now, I am shivering in my evening dress, in
              the freezer-like, empty, air-conditioned hall. I am glad to see the first guests
              arrive; we gather upstairs in the rooftop bar for our first drink of the evening.
              Here, the temperature of an early-summer evening in Shanghai feels comfortable and the
              breathtaking view of the Pudong skyline and the passing ships on the Bund leaves
              everyone in awe (Figure 31).</p>
            <p>Everyone, including me, takes pictures of the well-dressed people, the sunset, and
              the view; there is also a professional photographer, whom the students hired for the
              night. The setting clearly distinguishes the event from graduation balls in Germany.
              While the latter mostly take place in gymnasiums or auditoriums, the chosen location
              in Shanghai is a former warehouse that has been converted to a very high standard.
              Many guests congratulate the students for their great choice of this venue right by
              the docks that combines a marvelous view with simple elegance. Eventually, the guests
              move inside and are seated at large round tables according to a seating order the
              students have discussed for months. I join a table with some older siblings, friends,
              and former students of the school. The graduates all sit at a long table in the center
              of the hall. The evening features a buffet dinner, several talks, the students&#8217;
              dance, and a few pranks and games, including a high-heel-shoe running contest with the
              teachers. The graduates also show a home-made movie that features them talking about
              their classmates and their future plans, as well as saying thank you. I mingle and
              take photos (Figure 32). </p>
            <p>Around midnight, the students get ready to leave the location and invite everyone to
              move to the after-party location: a lounge bar in the heart of Shanghai&#8217;s former
              French concession that the graduates rented for the occasion. The tickets for the
              graduation ball come with a lace band wrapped around them, indicating each
              guest&#8217;s table number in Chinese characters. Later, if you wear the band around
              your wrist at the after-party, all drinks at the bar are free. Only the students,
              their friends and siblings, and several teachers come along. Parents are nowhere to be
              seen.</p>
            <p>Now, intoxication and partying, which Sande (<xref rid="IDc8040657-7cc4-4ff9-a373-f10084630d8b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID959f621e-c3a4-4715-91fb-8f657c784cbc">2002</xref>) describes as important
              parts of this rite of passage, are in full swing. Drinking and dancing with (now
              former) teachers creates a generally euphoric atmosphere as old barriers are torn
              down. The girls have all changed out of their long evening gowns and into short
              cocktail dresses; many pairs of high heels have been replaced by ballet flats. I busy
              myself with taking pictures and, after a while, students begin to ask me to take
              photos of them with their friends. I am happy to replace the photographer who has left
              by now, but also use the time to chat with various students. As the evening wears on,
              more and more students are found outside, in a small alley behind the club, sitting on
              the ground, talking to their friends, and enjoying the last of &#8220;their&#8221;
              night.</p>

          <title>1.3. Moving on: anticipation and anxieties</title>
          <p>During my final visit to Shanghai, the students and I bonded over the shared feeling of
            an unknown future and the difficulty of choosing a career path. Mia&#8217;s description
            of her struggle to make such a choice illustrates feelings expressed by the majority of
            the students I talked to:</p>

                &#8220;Oh, great!&#8221; and the others always said: &#8220;Hmm. Well, you can&#8217;t
              really earn a lot with that&#8221; or something similar. It was not necessarily about
              money, but simply like, you just can&#8217;t really&#160;&#8230; So many people do
              that. Well, there were always these kinds of reactions and somehow that made me think
              again. And then, one day, I was sitting, well, that was during Chinese New Year
              holidays, just before the written exams&#160;&#8230; I was sitting downstairs with my
              mother and we were talking and then I said, &#8220;Yes, actually I could also do
              something else.&#8221; On a sheet of paper on the table I wrote down everything that I
              find interesting. There were ten different things on it, some actually going into very
              different directions. [&#8230;] And then I thought, okay, I can take a look again at
              what I want to do. There are so many opportunities [&#8230;]. Shouldn&#8217;t
              underestimate that. And that&#8217;s why I am still looking and then I will
              apply.</italic>

          <p>Trying to find a path into the future, Mia weighs her interests, the opinions of
            friends and parents, and future job opportunities as well as possible income. Many
            scholarly explanations for youths&#8217; career choices and their employment histories
            have shifted their focus &#8220;towards poststructuralist accounts in which
            individuals&#8217; choices and their ability to judge and negotiate risk are seen as
            important in shaping their biographies&#8221; (<xref rid="ID793c5a0a-b8f4-4aa1-975b-724de9564ffe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID185425bb-ca42-4390-9135-d1a11b30b984">Valentine 2003, 41</xref>). Despite this
            individualization, social networks as &#8220;product[s] of specific social and physical
            environments,&#8221; still play a major role in &#8220;providing information about
            employment opportunities [&#8230;] and in developing social and cultural capital&#8221;

            demonstrates, this influence of the social network on career choices can also be
            observed among expatriate teenagers in Shanghai. For many of the students, the choice of
            a university program also goes along with the decision to relocate. Some set their
            priorities according to the likelihood of being accepted at a specific university, while
            others chose a location that appeals to them and then consider the different options for
            studying there. Olivia, for instance, wants to move back to her parents&#8217; home town
            in Belgium.</p>

              [their city]. Well, I still know a few people in Belgium. They are all going to [study
              there] as well, so I will also see them again there. And the girls, my friends from
              Shanghai, [&#8230;] they also study close to where I will go. So I will get to know
              Belgium a little. Because, I mean, I was very young when I left Belgium. [&#8230;] I
              would like to get to know Belgium a little, well, Europe in general. And that&#8217;s
              why, yes, I want to move to Belgium.</italic>

          <p>Olivia&#8217;s quote not only reveals her parents&#8217; influence on her choice of
            university location, but also her own desire to reconnect with her past, her broader
            family, and her national culture and mother tongue. It is these manifold desires and
            influences that the students must now negotiate when leaving Shanghai and choosing their
            next step&#8212;and stop&#8212;in their lives. Based on their ethnographic work with
            young people in Finland, Elina Lahelma and Tuula Gordon (<xref rid="IDeaaebdda-4b11-46ae-870e-4e33869edef9" ref-type="bibr" id="ID422c35cf-e1a7-428b-b5e3-da506079e6f8">2003, 381</xref>) argue that &#8220;moving
            away from home is full of ambivalence for young people. Most of them talk about it with
            terms of hopes, but also with terms of fear.&#8221; Although &#8220;home&#8221; is a
            flexible, rhizomatic nework of locations, practices, and ideas for most expatriate
            youths in my study (see Part III, Chapter 2), this is true for them as well.
            Furthermore, for the students in Shanghai, moving away from their family home often
            coincides with this home no longer existing. The following sections therefore highlight
            their specific fears and hopes.</p>
          <sec>
            <title>The challenge of everyday practicalities</title>
            <p>Many of the students I interviewed grew up with housekeeping staff at home and
              parents who demanded that their children focus on school rather than concerning
              themselves with the chores and demands of a household. Consequently, a few of the
              young people&#8217;s accounts reflect a fear that their future homes will lack the
              necessary equipment for preparing food or doing laundry, or that they themselves lack
              the skills to handle those tasks. Additionally, the students are nervous about
              unfamiliar lifestyles, such as student life in Germany. Peter, for instance, uses our
              interview to bombard me with questions about living in a shared flat with other
              students in Germany.</p>

            <p>Peter is not alone in his questions and concerns. When I meet Xia, the Chinese
              national whose story I described in detail in Part I, Chapter 4, to discuss his plans
              for the summer, he reports that he wants to prepare for his studies. When I inquire

            <p>When I comment that learning how to prepare Chinese dishes might be nice, as they may
              not be readily available in Germany, Xia shares his worries about missing China and
              Chinese food by relating the experience of several friends:</p>

                  after half a year she was homesick for China. She found that, in China, people are
                  much more open than in Germany. And the other said she was homesick for Chinese
                  vegetables. In Germany there is only salad. In China there are so many different
                  varieties of vegetables.</italic>

            <p>While many freshmen will experience similar concerns (whether they have had the
              advantage of an ayi or not), Xia&#8217;s fear is compounded by the knowledge that he
              will also lack access to the necessary incredients to prepare his favorite foods. In
              other words, Xia&#8217;s concerns about not being able to take care of himself in
              Germany are not limited to household practicalities, but also to simply feeling
              comfortable there. For expatriate youths, anxiety about moving on&#8212;or, in some
              cases, moving &#8220;back&#8221;&#8212;parallels larger anxieties about missing
              familiar things and the fear of not being able to fit in.</p>

              When we sit in a noisy coffee shop over breakfast, Charlie describes how, for her,
              this fear is particularly tied to prior experiences of racism and
              &#8220;othering&#8221; that she has endured due to her Asian phenotype.</p>

            <p>The prospect of moving to Germany reminds Charlie of painful experiences of exclusion

              cultural belonging that I explore throughout this ethnography, particularly in the
              introduction and Part III, Chapter 2. Simultaneously, Charlie&#8217;s anxiety about
              not fitting in is also linked to the fear of not being able to share the positive
              experiences of her time in Shanghai:</p>

                  isn&#8217;t it
                normal that you tell how beautiful the city is and so on? And then there are people

            <p>Moving on offers the opportunity to indulge in things that were missed in Shanghai,

          <title>1.4. Reflections on leaving Shanghai and what lies ahead</title>
          <p>All the students featured in this work see their move away from Shanghai as a crucial
            point in their lives and as the end of an important phase. Because leaving Shanghai is
            related to their graduation from high school, they have to make numerous decisions about
            their future, their career choices, and their new residence in particular. The young
            people I interviewed approach this move with mixed feelings. While some youths&#8217;
            parents stayed in Shanghai, others moved on to different destinations than their
            children. Only Olivia jointly relocated with her parents; her schoolmates&#8217;
            families, in contrast, are spread out across various locations, which means that, from
            now on, these students will have to cross great distances to see their families.</p>
          <p>My ethnographic material illustrates clearly how the collective rituals surrounding the
            traditional celebrations of the Abitur graduation offer a vital opportunity for students
            to cope as a group with these transitions: they combine the celebration of their
            academic achievements and the end of high school with bidding Shanghai farewell.
            Conversations with Matthias and a friend of Antonia, who both left the city prior to
            graduation and thus did not get to experience these combined rituals, suggest that this
            kind of closure makes moving on easier for those students who remain in Shanghai through
            graduation. The ceremonies, traditions, and parties that mark the end of students&#8217;
            school life and their time in Shanghai evolve from a mixture of German school traditions
            and Shanghai-specific memories. It is not surprising, therefore, that the students chose
            their all-time favorite club Mural, the converted warehouse with its specatcular view of
            the Bund, and a bar in the former French concession to commemorate their graduation as
            well as to say their &#8220;goodbyes&#8221; to the city. </p>
          <p>The move away from Shanghai, which for the majority of the students means moving back
            to Germany, is also met with thoughts about what is to come. Final destinations are
            often vague until responses from universities&#8212;which are awaited with anxious
            anticipation&#8212;are received. For many, university life means making a dream (such as
            Antonia&#8217;s goal of studying medicine) come true, but also evokes a fear of feeling
            lost in a new location. The youths particularly voiced their worries about navigating
            everyday practicalities in their new home, and their reservations about whether they
            would be able to fit in.</p>
          <p>The expatriate teenagers&#8217; plans to move sound rather definite. Although recent
            research has shown an increase in young people who move back and forth between their own
            and their parent&#8217;s homes (for more information on what has been dubbed the
            &#8220;boomerang phenomenon,&#8221; see Molgat 2002, 135), few of the students in this
            work considered returning to their parental home to be an option. This is not
            surprising, given that for the majority of them, the parental home was also dissolved in
            the next move, and is therefore not a fixed place that they can return to. Some students
            said they hoped to come back to Shanghai one day, but these ideas were never concretely
            formulated and never involved a specific plan, apart from the vague possibility of maybe
            receiving an expat post one day, too. While it remains to be seen whether these youths
            will ultimately follow in their parents&#8217; footsteps by living highly-mobile lives,
            the next chapter concludes this ethnography by investigating how the students fared
            after moving back to Germany, their new beginnings there, and their reflections on their
            time in Shanghai.</p>

        <title>Chapter 2. New Beginnings and Concluding Thoughts</title>
        <p>After graduation, the majority of the teenagers from the German school chose to
          &#8220;return&#8221; to their &#8220;home&#8221; country, which many of them only knew
          from early childhood or holidays, and enroll at universities. Only Kressi and Bjorn opted
          to stay in Shanghai to take a Chinese language course, while two other boys moved to
          Germany to carry out their military service and plan to attend university afterwards. The
          students chose Germany as a destination because of its respected and free university
          system, to reconnect with the country as such, and, as was mentioned previously, to
          explore German student life and the associated cultural practices in general. For the
          expatriate teenagers moving &#8220;back&#8221; also meant leaving their family homes,
          which by now are out of reach or no longer exist. Many of them began to pursue studies in
          engineering, business, or, as in Antonia&#8217;s case, medicine. </p>

        <p>I keep in touch with Antonia and some of her peers and occasionally even meet with them
          at birthday parties, sightseeing trips, or for lunch or coffee. In our conversations I
          sense how much they enjoy exploring Germany, which is simultaneously a familiar, yet
          foreign country. Being privy to their initial struggles, but also their success and their
          joy in discovering new things and making new friends, I begin to realize just how
          complicated their &#8220;return&#8221; turns out to be. </p>
        <p>In November 2012, I pick up Antonia at her new place to go out for lunch. Back in
          Shanghai we would hang out at her place, but now she does not ask me to come in,
          because&#8212;she apologizes&#8212;her room looks too chaotic. She is studying constantly
          and has no time to clean up. Besides, she admits, she still has not gotten used to doing
          such things yet, as her ayi always took care of housework. After lunch we get a coffee at
          Starbucks. While I am reminded of Shanghai&#8217;s Starbucks coffee shops and ponder the
          continuity these global chains seem to provide, Antonia tells me she feels that she moved
          out too early, having just turned eighteen. Her parents are still in Shanghai. It is
          difficult for her to suddenly be on her own.</p>
        <p>Eventually, in the summer of 2014&#8212;two years after their graduation&#8212;I conduct
          structured interviews with Antonia and Mia to discuss their experiences. In our follow-up
          interview, Antonia sits in my office and, with the voice recorder and questionnaire in
          front of us, she remembers her move to Germany and her initial feelings:</p>
        <p>
          <speech id="s30">
            <speaker>Antonia</speaker>
            <p>Moving itself went relatively, well, went really fast. I was travelling in America
              after graduation and then I went on a trip through Europe. And during the Europe trip
              I got accepted at university. I came back and had to find a flat within one week. And
              then my parents came and we moved everything and so on. I didn&#8217;t even think
              about it that much, and then university already started. [&#8230;] So somehow all this
              went super fast.</p>

        <p>Although very experienced in moving, Antonia&#8217;s former classmate Mia shares similar
          stories of loneliness during her first months in Germany. Both their narratives echo the
          students&#8217; retrospective accounts of what it was like to move to Shanghai that this
          book analyzed in Part II, Chapter 1. However, there is a significant difference: in 2012,
          Antonia and Mia decided themselves to move to Germany for their studies, while years
          earlier, many of the teenagers had not only felt disregarded in their family&#8217;s
          decision-making process to move to China but had often been reluctant, or initially even
          against the idea of going abroad. </p>
        <p>Faced with the family&#8217;s relocation, the children were caught between the desire to
          stay with their peers and the wish to be with their parents. They were actively weighing
          their parents&#8217; and their own interests. While the possibilities to explore new
          things with their family were exciting, they also feared the unpredictable experiences of
          moving to a new, unknown city. Many students therefore recalled having angrily confronted
          their parents, urging them to forgo the move. Other students said that their parents felt
          guilty for moving them out of their familiar environment, against their choice.
          Consequently, the move to Shanghai brought with it emotional challenges. This process was
          analysed in Part II, Chapter 2 as &#8220;culture shock:&#8221; students&#8217; reactions
          to an unfamiliar urban environment, new sensorial experiences combined with the lack of
          friends and extended family, and problems within the family related to the move.</p>
        <sec>
          <title><italic>Making a home again</italic></title>
          <p>Students&#8217; everyday practices upon arrival in Shanghai were primarily concerned
            with making Shanghai their new home and with becoming part of a new community, as I
            described in Part III, Chapter 1, which conveyed the continuous process of making sense
            of the city, not only in terms of navigation and sensory experience, but also in terms
            of positioning oneself within it&#8212;as consumers, inhabitants, or someone overwhelmed
            by the urban, sensorial landscape of Shanghai. Managing the city meant managing everyday
            life and the migration experience, for instance by learning how to navigate between
            spaces of everyday practices and consumption, by giving spaces a social meaning, or by
            dividing Shanghai into manageable, familiar areas and &#8220;the rest of the
            city.&#8221; In these analyses, practices of a retreat into familiarity already became
            apparent. Part III, Chapter 2 was concerned with notions of home. After providing a
            description of expatriate housing spaces&#8212;gated communities&#8212;it identified
            youths&#8217; small-scale home-making practices, such as decorating their rooms, or
            having regular family dinners, as well as larger processes of locating
            &#8220;home(s)&#8221; in their transnational networks. It demonstrated that, due to the
            expatriate teenagers&#8217; experiences of mobility, home was thought of as multiple and
            fluid, and tied to various places, items, and people. It became evident that making and
            (re)imagining homes, and collecting things to produce a sense of belonging helped the
            teenagers to cope with feelings of loneliness and enabled the rhizomatic home to
            &#8220;start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines&#8221; (<xref rid="ID7bc8b740-85f0-4552-841c-ad58a3bfe6cd" ref-type="bibr" id="ID008d890b-8845-419a-8f14-18e0c13b1c01">Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 9</xref>). </p>
          <p>For Mia, who moved with her family several times within Asia and between Asia and
            Germany, this (re)imagining and creating a home in Shanghai, as Part III, Chapter 2
            showcased, also included family routines. She had always considered her immediate family
            and the shared domestic life as the main ingredient for her feelings of being at
            home.</p>
          <p>Coming back to Germany after graduation is Mia&#8217;s first move without immediate
            family: </p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s39">
              <speaker>Mia</speaker>
              <p>Well, I&#8217;ve moved many times, but when I came home, my parents and siblings
                were always there and asked: &#8220;How are you? How was it?&#8221; And here I came
                home to empty rooms.</p>

                it wasn&#8217;t a problem at all. I knew what it was like to be new. But, as I said,
                coming home felt somehow, felt really strange.</italic>

          </p>
          <p>Furthermore, for Mia and her friends, the move to Germany is not only a first step of
            being on their own, but also a move out of the supportive expatriate
            &#8220;bubble.&#8221; Throughout their stay in Shanghai, the youths were surrounded by a
            community that shared experiences of moving. The international youths&#8217; resulting
            perceptions of Shanghai as a space of transit (see Introduction) were accompanied by
            feelings of belonging to an expatriate community that shared spatial and social
            practices and maintained various collective ways of managing migration processes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title><italic>Shanghai&#8217;s expat community and its support</italic></title>
          <p>A central role in this community is played by international schools, as described in
            Part III, Chapter 3, which are sites for the continuous everyday routine for expatriate
            youths, as well as a place for meeting new friends. There, collective expatriate
            identities were negotiated and mediated on an everyday basis&#8212;through community
            events, the communal valuing of the school for the youths&#8217; (cosmopolitan)
            formation, and through the admission process that required the &#8220;right&#8221;
            financial means or jobs, the &#8220;right&#8221; passports, and the &#8220;right&#8221;
            grades. Chinese nationals could only enroll in rare exceptions. Hence the schools
            brought together students from various international backgrounds, but&#8212;as with the
            gated communities described in Part II, Chapter 2&#8212;this diversity was highly
            controlled. The schools also offered parents an entrance to Shanghai&#8217;s expatria
            and fostered the development of a sense of community for many of the students and their
            families.</p>
          <p>In Germany, Antonia describes how she now experiences how difficult it can be to
            discuss the experience of moving and of growing up in Shanghai outside of this
            community.</p>

                beginning. Because they didn&#8217;t understand it, although I always said that
                I&#8217;m from Shanghai. For example [...] my flatmate, for her that was completely,
                she couldn&#8217;t imagine that. &#8220;What do you mean Shanghai?&#8221; And then

            form. From her time in the transit space of Shanghai, however. Mia and the other
            expatriate youths learned how to come to terms with initially unknown surroundings: by
            finding new things to do.</p>

          <title><italic>Exploring activities and spaces</italic></title>
          <p>In Shanghai, students like Antonia and Mia actively sought out and claimed their own
            spaces outside the gated communities and schools, which determined most of their
            everyday routines. Constructing collective age identities and exploring related spaces
            were crucial for the teenagers to gain meaning and agency in their migration experience,
            as was shown in Part IV, Chapter 2 on nightlife and Part IV, Chapter 3 on the hangout
            spot called &#8220;the shop.&#8221;</p>
          <p>To make a new home at university in Germany, Mia and Antonia apply this eagerness to
            explore new spaces and activities. Antonia, for instance, learned how to play the German
            card game Skat with her new fellow students and taught herself vegan cooking and baking.
            These activities also include reviving or strengthening old memories, habits, or ties to
            old friends or extended family in Germany. Food and family are aspects that occasionally
            evoke feelings of &#8220;return&#8221; and continuity mainly because these were also
            practiced as part of the rhizomatic home during the students&#8217; time in Shanghai and
            elsewhere (see Part III, Chapter 2).</p>

          <title><italic>Feeling or looking foreign </italic></title>
          <p>During their first few months in Germany, Antonia and Mia also come to terms with the
            incongruity of not being recognizably foreign at first sight, while often feeling alien.
            When Mia and I meet in early summer 2013&#8212;almost a year after her move&#8212;she
            talks about everyday incidents where she has to ask for help or information, for
            instance buying tram or train tickets, and feels local citizens are annoyed and do not
            understand how she could possibly not know these things. Other students share her
            experiences. Her former schoolmate Andrea remembers feeling awkward at the post office
            for not knowing the different forms or courier services available in Germany, and for
            later having to ask a friend where to put the address on the envelope. Students
            experience that the people in their new surroundings expect them to know these things,
            simply because they look German and speak the language fluently. Such stories juxtapose
            students&#8217; experiences of otherness in Shanghai, which I highlighted in Part IV,
            Chapter 4. In China, these white expatriate youths consciously experienced their
            physical difference as whites&#8212;many for the first time. This new and often
            uncomfortable feeling of difference promoted a preference for locations in Shanghai that
            were predominantly occupied by other whites. Many of their spatial practices therefore
            led to accepting or strengthening the exclusion of &#8220;China&#8221; from their
            everyday lives. Accompanied by special (and often preferential) treatment from Chinese
            citizens and a lack of interaction with Chinese youths, their foreign appearance fuelled
            their feelings of merely being &#8220;guests&#8221; in China. The new narratives of
            being not recognizably foreign in Germany can hence also be understood as a loss of the
            special&#8212;often experienced as privileged&#8212;treatment they received in
            Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Antonia and Mia&#8217;s reflections on their time in Shanghai and how they think it
            influenced them warrants a return to this ethnography&#8217;s initial questions that I
            raised in the Introduction: what are the experiences and consequences of growing up on
            the move? To reach a differentiated answer to this complex and difficult question, the
            theoretical foundations on which this study is built favor transcultural theories and
            their application to ethnographic research on privileged migrant youths, challenging the
            simplistic concept of TCKs that, for some time, was the common approach to categorizing
            youths like those that inform this work.</p>

          <title><italic>The role of age in the youths&#8217; own perspectives, dependency, and
              agency</italic></title>
          <p>My first research aim was to understand the youths&#8217; own perspectives on global
            mobility. Although teenagers experienced their move to Shanghai in many ways similar to
            the adult community, there was also a range of different, age-specific experiences.</p>
          <p>The students were minors whose move depended (solely) on the decisions of their
            parents. Their memories of leaving, examined in Part II, showed that students&#8217;
            dependence on their family and their lack of choice was always clear to them.
            Furthermore, their prescribed everyday school lives left little time and space for the
            expression of individual agency. Because they regularly shared spaces&#8212;for example
            the international schools (see Part III, Chapter 3)&#8212;with peers of the same age and
            with similar experiences, collective forms of coping with the move and the new
            environment could be forged. Together, students developed a social space distinct from
            the adult community. The teenagers claimed and frequented a variety of social meeting
            places including Shanghai&#8217;s nightclubs, or spaces that lay in-between different
            social worlds and authorities, such as the hangout place called &#8220;the shop.&#8221;
            Collectively exploring and shaping these spaces proved to be age-specific ways of
            managing the move while still remaining in a relationship of dependency from parents.
            Furthermore, youths&#8212;constantly confronted with the idea of development, of
            becoming an adult&#8212;seemed to reflect more than adults on the impact that moving and
            living in several places had on them and how this shaped their points of view and
            future. These reflections illustrate the second point of my investigation, the
            expatriate youths&#8217; negotiations of identity.</p>

        <sec>
          <title><italic>Identity negotiations: demarcation and globality versus transcultural
              perspectives</italic></title>
          <p>The youths&#8217; own perspectives illustrated throughout this ethnography, for
            instance in Part I, Chapter 4, show that common notions of home, belonging, or cultural
            identity are too limited to capture the complexities of their childhoods abroad.
            Expatriate youths live in a highly mobile and culturally complex environment and the
            teenagers found myriad ways to negotiate, forge, perform, and contest their forms of
            belonging and positions in their social worlds. My ethnographic work examined these ways
            and revealed two seemingly contradictory tendencies in their everyday practices. On the
            one hand, there are those daily activities and ways of living that maintain rigid
            cultural and class divisions, often tied to a wish for comfort and continuity, but also
            to feelings of superiority and hopes for status creation and future benefits; on the
            other hand, there are practices informed by curiosity and self-reflexivity allowing and
            fostering the emergence of transcultural perspectives.</p>
          <p>These first practices of demarcation and distinction became very apparent in the
            youths&#8217; spatial divisions of the city into expat and non-expat places as described
            in Part III, Chapter 1, which are also succinctly illustrated in the students&#8217;
            mental maps (such as in Figure 8). These practices are also evident in the absence of
            friendships or even contact with Chinese youths (see Part IV, Chapter 4). This lack of
            exchange with local teenagers&#8212;or local citizens in general&#8212;is fostered by
            the withdrawal into gated communities with a high percentage of foreigners (see Part
            III, Chapter 2) as well as by the fact that international schools are not allowed to
            take in Chinese students due to prohibitive rules by the Chinese government (see Part
            III, Chapter 3). Engaged in practices of demarcation from the local environment, the
            young privileged migrants, nevertheless, claimed urban and cosmopolitan identities. My
            study shows that for expatriate youths, as Hindman (<xref rid="IDfea73e21-71b8-4252-b7fc-a29b9210498a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2262a22f-7122-4c2f-aabf-7dd9843b744c">2009a, 250</xref>) observed of adult
            expatriates in Nepal, &#8220;culture is important as a means of justifying their
            presence abroad,&#8221; but difference is often only allowed in a prescribed, safe
            &#8220;niche&#8221; and in a &#8220;commodifiable form&#8221; (<xref rid="IDfea73e21-71b8-4252-b7fc-a29b9210498a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID81b2f1d9-aab3-4df0-a416-8b04b47b2c25">ibid., 267</xref>). Similar to

            lives of India&#8217;s middle class, such cosmopolitanism can be seen as &#8220;a
            practice of status-creation&#8221; (<xref rid="ID14c544fa-1515-418d-baad-68721773b553" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4a6603c8-62b2-45c9-a106-b810920dedcb">2010, 26</xref>).
            Shanghai&#8217;s urban environment often only provides the backdrop for learning and
            claiming cosmopolitanism or expatriateness. The skills acquired through the experiences
            in Shanghai bring status and competencies or, as Binder (<xref rid="ID5784a023-edca-4603-a962-615d4f39eb34" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbc897b71-15ec-4c0d-9fb6-042dbc9b9bbc">2005</xref>) calls it,
            &#8220;globality,&#8221; to the youths. This globality must be seen as a cultural
            resource in the Bourdieusian sense&#8212;as capital. The ways in which students imagine
            their future careers proved this particularly well. Growing up abroad and receiving an
            international education are considered by expatriate students (see Part III, Chapter 3)
            and the community&#8212;as the graduation speech held by the principle of the German
            school illustrated in the previous chapter&#8212;to be clear benefits of global
            mobility. In Shanghai, the international schools consider providing, fostering, and
            ultimately transforming their students&#8217; global experiences into globality and
            capital, to be part of their educational duties. Globality is a community marker and
            value. However, while international schools foster an international community that sees
            itself as open-minded, diverse, and cosmopolitan, they do so without including the local
            neighborhood, Shanghai, or China as a whole. While expatriate youths and their families
            create their own communities, often revolving around these schools, they demarcate
            themselves from Shanghai &#8220;locals&#8221; as well as from those back
            &#8220;home&#8221;&#8212;both are perceived as lacking international experience. The
            performance of a collective expatriate identity is thus not only tied to aspiring to and
            learning cosmopolitan values, but simultaneously connected to practices of demarcation
            from &#8220;others&#8221; perceived as less mobile, globally connected, and
            educated.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, looking at these processes, the age-specific context has to be kept in
            mind: parents play the major role in planning their children&#8217;s lives and making
            decisions in their &#8220;best interest&#8221; (<xref rid="IDfa1a348d-b01e-4963-a17f-0adfb50e9d47" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb27a4104-12d2-4699-b7c9-78a2cea6430c">see Ackers and Stalford 2004</xref>; <xref rid="ID28adb433-e671-45bb-93bf-a89b2fbefb1b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID58de0f07-4d81-44ad-9440-c373dc4067c4">Hutchins 2011</xref>), as exemplified in
            youths&#8217; retrospectives on leaving in Part II, Chapter 1. </p>
          <p>In my view, many &#8220;expatriates&#8217; places&#8221; in Shanghai were not spaces
            that particularly fostered the process of transculturation because transculturation
            means a process of allowing space for difference (<xref rid="IDa871b605-1750-4cdb-ac3c-b3fd8c9fa1fe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3bfd68a6-4f38-490b-8e6f-31e1bcfe1fed">Hoerder, H&#233;bert, and Schmitt
              2005</xref>), rather than leaving difference outside the walls, putting it in a
            &#8220;niche,&#8221; or staging it at as the &#8220;other.&#8221; These demarcation
            processes, which circumscribe so much of the teenagers&#8217; lives in Shanghai, could
            render the application of the term &#8220;transcultural&#8221; to the accumulation of
            experiences that I identified as globality far-fetched. After all,
            &#8220;transculturation is the process of individuals and societies changing themselves
            by integrating diverse cultural life-ways into dynamic new ones&#8221; (<xref rid="IDa871b605-1750-4cdb-ac3c-b3fd8c9fa1fe" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3420504b-00f8-40bb-8126-6ca2cd8f1287">Hoerder, H&#233;bert, and Schmitt
              2005</xref>, 13). </p>
          <p>However, my ethnography revealed that the young migrants&#8217; activities and
            viewpoints were significantly informed by curiosity and self-reflexivity, thus allowing
            and fostering the emergence of transcultural perspectives. When spending time with
            youths and listening to their subjective experiences of their transient stays in
            Shanghai, I encountered many reflections that were concerned with culturally complex
            entanglements, experiences, and challenges that forced these teenagers to position
            themselves in a world that others often culturally divide for them. These subjective
            experiences of in-between positions linked to processes of transculturation complicated
            and challenged the focus on demarcation and status-gain that I had witnessed and which
            other studies on expatriates have focused on. The examined processes of identity
            positioning and the meaning of the stay for different expatriate teenagers, as
            highlighted in Part I, Chapter 4, as well as their fluid, translocal, and multiple
            conceptions of home and belonging, as analyzed in Part III, Chapter 2, showed that the
            generation of expatriate teenagers that I worked with was often forced to negotiate
            difference, regardless of how hermetic the expat &#8220;bubble&#8221; may have seemed.
            In contrast to their parents, some children lacked a deep understanding of their
            &#8220;home culture,&#8221; since some of them had only been born in their &#8220;home
            country&#8221; but left it at a very early age; others only knew &#8220;their&#8221;
            country from the occasional holiday spent there with family. Furthermore, many of the
            youths came from mixed marriages or were second generation migrants who had become
            mobile again and &#8220;returned&#8221; to China for a certain period. Many of the
            expatriate teenagers I met therefore had to find ways to bridge differences between
            parents, or school and parents, on a daily basis, and from an early age. Additionally,
            being in China provoked reflections on social practices and shared values. Some
            students, like Karina, who after her stay chose to major in Chinese at college, or those
            like Antonia, Charlie, Don, or Arnaud, who had Chinese family backgrounds, continuously
            reflected upon their own &#8220;Chineseness.&#8221; In short, the specifity of China
            mattered. </p>
          <p>Furthermore, the move&#8217;s impact on relationship networks&#8212;such as being away
            from extended family and friends&#8212;triggered all the students to think about
            themselves, their cultural identities, and what was important for them to feel at home.
            Some reflected on cultural or educational influences (see for example Paul&#8217;s
            thoughts in the Introduction, or those of Antonia, Xia, and Arnaud in Part IV, Chapter
            1), while others considered mostly class and their expatriate status (see Bjorn&#8217;s
            comments, also in Part IV, Chapter 1). While my influence as an ethnographer cannot be
            denied, these findings resonate with Melissa Butcher&#8217;s description of Australian
            transnational professionals and their experiences in Asia: &#8220;Transnational movement
            subsequently engenders a process of identity re-evaluation as mobility, and inevitable
            contact with difference, disrupt the familiar cultural frames of reference that underpin
            identities, including established relationship networks&#8221; (<xref rid="ID0dad7738-aa83-485b-8025-94ac82b47cf5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9c137142-470b-4fa7-9bd0-75ab87545b6d">Butcher 2009, 1354</xref>).</p>
          <p>My ethnography, therefore, recognizes the students&#8217; emerging abilities to cope
            with changes and difference as part of the development of a transcultural perspective.
            It is this transcultural perspective that enabled them to reflect upon their culturally
            complex environment and its meanings for and influences on their own positions and
            narratives of the self. These transcultural perspectives functioned as tools to re-find
            spaces and moments of comfort in diverse and mobile cultural contexts, whether at an
            American or German school, an expatriate nightlife location, at Chinese
            grandparents&#8217; homes, or in mixed-marriage family life.</p>

          <title><italic>Spatial practices and emplaced experiences</italic></title>
          <p>My third research aim was to analyze expatriate youths&#8217; everyday spatial
            practices and their (dis)engagement with the &#8220;local.&#8221; Dynamic relations
            between spatial boundaries, their transgressions, and the claiming of expatriate and age
            identities were brought sharply to the fore in my examination of students&#8217;
            everyday practices of social space. Youths in Shanghai experienced less spatial and
            social constraints than youths in Europe, particularly regarding access to restaurants,
            bars, and nightclubs (see Part IV). Despite this relative sense of freedom, Shanghai
            students experienced most of the everyday spaces they frequented as highly regulated due
            to the strict processes of demarcation that the expatriate community undertook to define
            for itself; examples are the spaces of the gated communities and the international
            schools (Part III).</p>
          <p>Students&#8217; practices in these spaces were diverse and contradictory. Looking at
            &#8220;diaspora space&#8221; (<xref rid="ID3488cac3-f6eb-4110-8d65-0fc23839b56c" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2876a871-73b1-45c7-9d61-bbcd0dc63754">Brah 1996</xref>) in
            Shanghai&#8212;the encounters and moments of entanglement between the privileged
            migrants and those who stayed in Shanghai&#8212;it became clear that a strong
            local-expat divide was maintained, making the transgressions difficult for expatriate
            teenagers in general. Only a few locations, like the shop, provided a shared space for
            locals and expat youths. But while the shop played a central role, it is set outside the
            glamorous image of the metropolis, and it is this image, rather than any direct,
            unregulated involvement with its actual inhabitants and spaces, that led to
            students&#8217; identifications with Shanghai. Nevertheless, the teenagers&#8217;
            turning towards the city&#8217;s transnational spaces and aiming to be part of the
            city&#8217;s cosmopolitan image still professes, at least to some extent, their
            engagement with the contemporary situation in China&#8217;s megalopolis. The
            relationship between expatriate youths and their physical environment shapes their
            everyday lives as much as the expatriate networks that they belong to. Their interaction
            with their immediate surroundings offers a way to not only cope with the difficulties of
            the overall migration experience, but also to represent this experience as worthwhile
            and successful. Shanghai&#8217;s urban environment provided students with the backdrop
            for learning and claiming certain forms of cosmopolitan identity that I have identified
            specifically as &#8220;expatriateness&#8221; (see Part III, Chapter 3). </p>

          <title><italic>Returning to where?</italic></title>
          <p>Although Shanghai is an exciting city, the majority of the teenagers from the German
            school chose to &#8220;return&#8221; to their &#8220;home&#8221; country, which many of
            them only knew from early childhood or holidays. However, as Antonia and Mia&#8217;s
            accounts show, there is no simple homecoming to a certain, stable status quo. The idea
            of &#8220;home,&#8221; as I argue throughout this ethnography, is a complicated matter
            and is tied to various emotions and places. Home is also a matter of perspective.</p>
          <p>Two years after leaving China, the idea of &#8220;return,&#8221; for Mia and Antonia,
            is becoming linked to Shanghai: the city is still a connecting place in their
            friendships to which they frequently retreat&#8212;imagined, virtually, or
            physically&#8212;to strengthen their ties and to find emotional support. During an
            interview in the summer of 2014, Mia and I are sitting in her room in a shared student
            flat and I inquire about her current relationship to Shanghai. Mia explains when and how
            she and her friends remember the city:</p>

            <speech id="s52">
              <speaker>Mia</speaker>
              <p>When, for example, I&#8217;m in contact with Antonia, Charlie, and so on, that is a
                group in which everyone has very strong ties to Shanghai. [&#8230;] Because we all
                lived there for such a long time, and were together in this group, we all were
                always so, we completely hyped it. [&#8230;].</p>

                and forth, and that&#8217;s why, at these times, when someone is visiting, it is

              <p>True, and it is always like that when we see each other. [&#8230;] In that respect,
                there is certainly a very strong connection. [&#8230;] I often look at old pictures,
                but at the same time that somehow depresses me a bit. I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s
                always like, I am simply homesick. [&#8230;] I think about it a lot, and I have many
                things in my room that remind me of it. [&#8230;] When you drink tea, you drink it
                out of a Shanghai Starbucks mug. [&#8230;] This kind of connection is always there,
                really, pretty much every day. But of course it is sometimes stronger and sometimes
                weaker. But, erm, for example if you, if friends who still live there, if they post
                pictures, then you&#8217;re always like, &#8220;oh, how beautiful,&#8221; and then I
                really enjoy looking at these. Also from people who I don&#8217;t know, or only

          <p>To former expatriate youths, &#8220;returning&#8221; is a practice of remembering and
            reviving old connections while simultaneously establishing new ones and exploring new
            places, rather than moving back to a fixed geographical location or network. </p>
          <p>Despite a &#8220;return&#8221; to Germany, their lives are still characterized by ties
            to diverse locations and by global mobility. Consequently, although feelings of
            belonging to the new environment are being established, they are often also experienced
            as contested. For expatriate youths spaces of &#8220;home&#8221; and notions of
            &#8220;return&#8221; also remain extremely mobile&#8212;perhaps especially after leaving
            the transit space of Shanghai and moving to those countries that issued their
            passports.</p>

          <title><italic>My personal stance</italic></title>
          <p>The narratives of the teenagers&#8217; experience as they passed through Shanghai have
            often touched me. Their simultaneous ignorance, acceptance, and unwarranted
            transgressions of cultural boundaries at times irritated me, and their occasional lack
            of interest in Chinese society shocked me. Their attempts and abilities to cope with
            constant change and difference impressed me, and their honest reflections upon and
            willingness to share their own lives enlightened me. To capture their positions, which
            are on the one hand marked by privilege, and on the other by extreme dependence and
            painful uprootings, was a personal and academic challenge; as I have shown, the
            characteristics and the varieties of teenagers&#8217; experiences of privileged
            migration are very diverse. But all these youths considered passing through Shanghai a
            chance to gain a new outlook. It remains to be seen if, in time, these transcultural
            perspectives will manifest themselves either in rigid identity positions that claim
            cosmopolitanism or globality solely for themselves (see my argumentation against the
            concept of TCKs in the Introduction), or if they will instead be able to keep their
            flexibility and creative ways of incorporating difference.</p>
          <p> It is beyond the aim of this ethnography to make concrete recommendations on extended
            family stays abroad, but the stories in this book suggest&#8212;at least to
            me&#8212;that it is wise to involve children in the decision-making process and, once
            the decision is made, in the preparations for the move. Furthermore, while it is
            important to create a familiar comfort zone, parents can also set an example of how to
            engage with new environments by not simply withdrawing into &#8220;bubbles.&#8221; I am
            convinced that open-mindedness and a shared eagerness to explore can help all family
            members make their stay more meaningful than the advancement of the breadwinner&#8217;s
            career alone ever could. Such an attitude can support children in forging new
            experiences into self-reflective transcultural perspectives that are based on an empathy
            for and appreciation of differences, and to help overcome the rigid divisions of
            nationality, gender, class, or ethnicity that are still present in all our lives.</p>

          <title><italic>Future studies</italic></title>
          <p>Many questions remain unanswered. I want to address four points that are worth, even
            crucial to, exploration in further research.</p>
          <p>First, now that I have traced the &#8220;here-and-now&#8221; (<xref rid="ID597076fc-932a-4f91-8ddf-6ad26e00f9e3" ref-type="bibr" id="ID27d4f189-56d2-42d3-91b5-e867fc1ba8db">Bucholtz 2002, 532</xref>) of
            students&#8217; migration experiences, their future paths could be explored. A
            longitudinal approach is necessary to trace the impact of growing up on the move on
            their future careers and lifestyle choices. The influence of the teenager&#8217;s social
            situations on their educational and career trajectories has long been caught in a
            conundrum of structure versus agency (<xref rid="ID822a3a74-9daa-45a3-a05f-9b174820bf5a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2d378d12-392e-455b-bbf3-a348490572bd">Milner 2004,
              15&#8211;17</xref>). As suggested earlier, following the ways in which expatriate
            children, such as my informants, exercise their privileged upbringing and what kind of
            rigid or mobile subjectivities they will choose to keep as identity references would be
            a worthwhile endeavour.</p>
          <p>Second, I agree with Fechter and Walsh (<xref rid="IDcbcc34b5-a079-41ed-a6e4-2b7fc8bae7dc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDff2fe369-98f7-40df-a53e-945f589ffd6d">2010, 1207</xref>), who point to the need
            to &#8220;produce research that does engage with locals&#8217; perspectives on
            expatriates in a variety of contexts.&#8221; For studies looking at expatriates in
            China, this means we need a focus on Chinese locals&#8217; points of view on expatriates
            to flesh out issues such as demarcations between the communities and the lack of contact
            between locals and expatriates, or to investigate the complex dynamics of race in
            everyday life in China.</p>
          <p>Third, the question of what role China specifically played in the students&#8217;
            development remains partly unanswered and also constitutes a significant concern for
            further research on the topic of expatriate youths. To address this concern
            meaningfully, comparative research on expatriate youths&#8217; experiences in other
            locations is needed. Although Chinese or Shanghainese particularities have been pointed
            out in the present study, it is not possible to determine the extent to which the
            &#8220;host&#8221; country influenced the age-specific experience of these privileged
            migrants. While the practices of demarcation and boundary drawing, for instance, seem to
            be very similar to those of adult expatriate communities&#8212;whether in Jakarta (<xref rid="IDf82585c1-f9a0-4cdf-a1ae-0e56578b02bb" ref-type="bibr" id="IDda4d8ab2-2fc1-46a6-9fc2-26d5a5ff6c02">Fechter 2007a</xref>; <xref rid="IDd96188de-372e-4b1c-82cd-5cbbb2aafc03" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9363261f-d863-4cca-928f-57c13f480150">Fechter 2007b</xref>), Dubai (<xref rid="ID1bd2d3ed-27bd-4ca3-a0a3-52b36b8dc141" ref-type="bibr" id="ID25f84f9f-e49c-49d2-b3e7-4cb418259524">Walsh 2006a</xref>; <xref rid="ID8a8cf319-3fa5-4d9e-aa08-ae21cc3f82b1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDf0d43de3-1b84-48a4-912a-94c0b08d2d33">Walsh 2006b</xref>; <xref rid="ID34621657-3452-4808-955a-8f3f6f312c26" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0f8e0437-e91e-4a62-953e-9349776c869f">Walsh 2008</xref>; <xref rid="ID3612cbbe-16cd-4090-918a-c079bc49c699" ref-type="bibr" id="IDef32cebe-c237-44b9-96e9-a699af0b7c3e">Walsh 2011</xref>), Singapore (<xref rid="ID4db4d41b-22cd-4411-82e4-5d5660b5931d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID061f4308-1e2a-414f-972c-a23c4afed0c9">Beaverstock 2002</xref>; <xref rid="IDf7ddf8f7-15a4-41d1-8a88-ccfd5896cf05" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbef08c2e-c06e-4014-8eef-50489df8d61a">Beaverstock 2011</xref>), Nepal (<xref rid="IDfea73e21-71b8-4252-b7fc-a29b9210498a" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8606c39c-5474-4019-b6c3-dfaa14710db7">Hindman 2009a</xref>; <xref rid="IDcf8a54f2-f840-428f-ba53-392218f338e1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID67fd448d-6d4b-411f-8546-df10d2a1814f">Hindman 2009b</xref>), Hong Kong (<xref rid="ID6b47e04b-a79c-4729-8c6f-9fea94212700" ref-type="bibr" id="ID42538d87-0de2-4459-82c5-af2ca2099624">Yeoh and Willis 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ID71199ddf-7f5b-4ee9-8c7c-31bf63f80489" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1a709448-b51a-4936-b2a0-98d30ca53b79">Willis and Yeoh 2008</xref>), Sao Paulo

            youths&#8217; experiences can vary greatly in respect to the schools they attend.
            Different school systems and the enrollment of local students in other countries could
            make mixing with &#8220;local&#8221; youths easier elsewhere than it is in Shanghai,
            where the spaces to interact are particularly limited.</p>
          <p>Lastly, a study that brings together experiences of privileged and less privileged
            forms of youth migration would undoubtedly yield important insights into
            children&#8217;s strategies of coping with family migration generally. Combining these
            research fields, which until now have been approached separately, can, for example,
            highlight the challenges, but also the strengths and capabilities of young migrants from
            less privileged backgrounds, who are often marginalized because of their circumstances
            and whose skills often remain unacknowledged. The longing for continuity and reminders
            of &#8220;home&#8221; that expatriate youths experience can provide a much-needed bridge
            to understanding practices of migration that are perceived as foreign or not adapted
            enough&#8212;something which politicians or media in western societies tend to dismiss
            as leading towards a &#8220;parallel society.&#8221; In this context, combined research
            into the various forms of youth migration can elucidate the important role played by
            institutional support, for example from schools. </p>
          <p>The teenagers I accompanied were privileged in many ways and their advantaged
            positions, which allowed them to compensate for the losses and anxieties that moving
            brought with it, are in stark, even shocking contrast to the hundreds of thousands of
            refugees that are currently seeking asylum in Europe. Comparing these different
            circumstances, along with the agency that children and teenagers can develop by coming
            to terms with them, could inform policies and services that help migrant children and
            youths with the challenges they have to face. The resulting insights could contribute to
            establishing adequate assistance at schools and community centers and to creating shared
            spaces that encourage self-reflection and the development of the transcultural
            perspectives needed to manage the consequences of global mobility.</p>

            tags&#252;ber megaviel zu tun. Das war voll sch&#246;n. Ich hab ganz viele neue Leute

            kommen nicht auf die Idee, dass ich aus dem Ausland komme. [&#8230;] Ich sehe ja nicht
            so aus, und ich rede ja auch nicht so. Und komme halt auch nicht daher. Dass es da
            Unterschiede f&#252;r mich gibt, irgendwie, habe ich das anfangs immer versucht zu
            betonen, weil die es nicht verstanden haben, auch wenn ich immer gesagt habe: &#8220;Ich
            bin aus Shanghai.&#8221; Also zum Beispiel [&#8230;] meine Mitbewohnerin, das war
            f&#252;r sie total, das konnte sie sich gar nicht vorstellen. &#8220;Was, wie

          Antonia: <italic>Das haben die einfach nicht realisiert, dass ich aus einem anderen Land
            komme. Und dann habe ich das so lange betont, bis ich die alle genervt habe. Weil es
            auch so unvorstellbar ist also. Weil es ja auch nicht richtig chinesisch ist, weil das
            war ja so eine komische Gesellschaft in der wir in Shanghai gelebt haben. Das habe ich
            auch immer versucht zu beschreiben wie es war. Weil die einfach nicht verstehen wie es
            war. Also. Dass ich irgendwie versucht habe [&#8230;] die Unterschiede und die
            Gemeinsamkeiten und so weiter, dass ich versucht habe mich zu erkl&#228;ren.</italic>

          Gef&#252;hl hat [&#8230;], dass man sich besser kennt. Das ging nicht so schnell. Weil
          halt einfach in Shanghai immer dieses Ding war, jeder wei&#223; wie es ist, neu zu sein.
          Interviewer: Ja. Mia: Und ehm, jeder war mal neu. [&#8230;] Es war ja sowieso so ein
          konstanter Wechsel, und&#8232;ehm, dadurch wusste man irgendwie, wie es geht,
          Freundschaften schneller zu schlie&#223;en, weil man genau wusste, okay, wenn du jetzt
          erst mal zwei Jahre brauchst, bis du gut befreundet bist, dann ist die Person ja schon
          wieder weg. [&#8230;] Das Ganze ging dann irgendwie schneller. [&#8230;] W&#228;hrend hier
          ist es so, [&#8230;] im Endeffekt sucht am Anfang jeder ja auch nach neuen Leuten, weil,
          [&#8230;] man kennt ja niemanden. [&#8230;] D<italic>eswegen ist es dann schon so, dass,
            ehm, </italic>man da schnell Leute findet, aber es ist halt nicht so schnell, so, so eng
          und vertraut [wie in Shanghai]. Weil irgendwie kommen doch alle aus anderen

            Kontakt hab, das ist ja total so &#8217;ne ganze Gruppe wo wir alle &#8217;nen sehr
            starken Shanghai-Bezug haben. [&#8230;] Dadurch dass wir da alle so lange gelebt haben
            und in dieser Konstellation so zusammen waren, waren wir alle auch immer so, dass wir
            das einfach total gehypt haben [&#8230;].</italic> Interviewer:
            <italic>&lt;L&gt;</italic> Mia: <italic>Also, dass wir halt immer sagen: &#8220;Oh, wir
            m&#246;chten zur&#252;ck und es war alles so toll.&#8221; [&#8230;] Von ein paar von
            denen wohnen ja noch die Eltern da, das hei&#223;t die sind dann auch &#246;fter da.
            [&#8230;] Und dann redet man ja auch viel dar&#252;ber, und dann schickt man Fotos hin
            und her, und deswegen, also zu den Zeiten ist es immer besonders stark, wenn halt da
            grade jemand zu Besuch ist. Aber auch sonst reden wir schon viel dar&#252;ber.</italic>
          Interviewer: <italic>Ja.</italic> Mia: <italic>Ja oder besonders auch wenn wir uns sehen.
            Also es ist, ich weiss nicht, hatte Antonia dir eigentlich dieses Gedicht gezeigt, was
            ich geschrieben hatte?</italic> Interviewer: <italic>Ja, ja.</italic> Mia: <italic>Ja,
            und da hatt ich ja auch diese [Zeilen] geschrieben von wegen, ja wir trinken auf eine
            Stadt die wir lieben, so ein bisschen, und das ist halt auch
            irgendwie&#160;&#8230;</italic>Interviewer: <italic>Da musste ich auch wirklich an so
            konkrete Situationen denken, wo wir das gemacht haben.</italic> Mia: <italic>Genau, und
            so ist es halt immer, wenn wir uns sehen. [&#8230;] Also in der Hinsicht ist auf jeden
            Fall ein sehr starker Bezug da. [&#8230;] Ich kuck mir halt auch wirklich sehr oft alte
            Bilder an, aber gleichzeitig deprimiert mich das auch irgendwie so ein bisschen. Ich
            wei&#223; nicht, das ist immer so, es ist halt einfach Heimweh dann [&#8230;]. Ich denke
            viel dar&#252;ber nach und ich hab ja auch viele Sachen in meinem Zimmer die mich
            irgendwie daran erinnern [&#8230;]. Wenn man Tee trinkt, trinkt man halt aus so
            &#8217;ner Shanghai Starbucks-Tasse. [&#8230;] Also so ein Bezug ist auf jeden Fall
            immer da, also wirklich auch jeden Tag. [&#8230;] Aber nat&#252;rlich ist es mal mehr,
            mal weniger. Aber ehm, zum Beispiel auch wenn man dann von Freunden die da noch wohnen,
            wenn die dann Fotos posten, dann ist man immer so: &#8220;Aah, wie sch&#246;n,&#8221;
            und das kuck ich mir dann auch wirklich gern an. Oder von Leuten die ich dann nicht
            kenne, sondern nur um zwei Ecken.</italic> Interviewer: <italic>Ja.</italic> Mia:
            <italic>Wenn du dann irgendwie auf Instagram denen folgen kannst, und dann siehst du,
            &#8220;Ach was haben die nicht wieder f&#252;r ein sch&#246;nes Foto von der Skyline
            gepostet.&#8221; [&#8230;] So was kuck ich mir schon echt gerne an.</italic>
          Interviewer: <italic>&lt;L&gt;</italic> Mia: <italic>[&#8230;] Ja ich hab da einfach gerne
            gewohnt, und dann ist das dann so, dass man das nicht so schnell vergisst.</italic>
