                        and Transcultural Approaches in Expatriate Youth Research</italic>
                </title>
              
                <p> It is Saturday afternoon and seventeen-year-old Paul is sitting opposite me at a
                    caf&#233; on Wulumuqi Road in downtown Shanghai. Below our window, buses, taxis,
                    honking electric scooters, and pedestrians carrying umbrellas to shield off the
                    sun pass by until they disappear into the narrow, sycamore-tree-lined streets of
                    the former French concession. Inside, the air conditioning is humming and music
                    is playing in the background, while Paul, who has been introduced to me as an
                    &#8220;American student&#8221; by our common acquaintance Matthias, shares his
                    story of growing up on the move. Paul is a German national, born in Brazil to a
                    Brazilian mother and a German father. He grew up in Brazil and the United States
                    and moved to Shanghai six years prior to the interview. Here, he is enrolled in
                    one of Shanghai&#8217;s American schools. Learning that his father is German,
                    like me, I wonder if we should switch to my native language for the interview.
                    Noticing my general difficulty comprehending the many moves, places, tongues,
                    and people that he references, Paul helps by clarifying his language skills:</p>

                        <p>And China. And Brazil. But I speak very little German. I can
                            understand it. Okay. But I can&#8216;t speak it really. I can say like:
                            hello, thank you, please. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e58">1</xref>
                        </p>
                    </speech>
                </p>
                <p>As I listen to his account of the many moves and languages to which he has
                    already been exposed at his young age, I begin to understand that Paul can
                    hardly be sufficiently represented by the label &#8220;American student&#8221;
                    that I had assigned to him before our encounter. His experiences include growing
                    up on the move in a bi-national family. His and his parents&#8217;
                    nationalities, languages, and cultural practices differ both from those of his
                    school and from his country of residence. Until recently, he never lived in
                    Germany, the country that issued his passport, nor does he speak the language
                    that it is written in. He has limited Chinese language skills and few contacts
                    to locals of his age because activities and friendships outside of Jinqiao,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e66">2</xref> or the expatriate &#8220;bubble&#8221;
                    as he calls it, are rare.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e73">3</xref> His
                    description of this &#8220;bubble&#8221; is reminiscent of the accounts by
                    mobile professionals&#8217; transnational practices summarized by cultural and
                    urban geographer David Ley:</p>

                            work, bars, and sporting and expatriate clubs. [...] The outcome is a
                            lifeworld that is the opposite of the expansive and inclusive networks
                            implied by ungrounded or deterritorialized networks. Instead, the social
                            geography of the transnational elite may be highly localized, restricted
                            to particular territories. As they are dispatched internationally from
                            city to city, the transnational capitalist class are island hopping from
                            one expatriate enclave to another (<xref rid="ID460ada26-f0dc-47bf-893e-083562281856" ref-type="bibr" id="ID99b84c62-546d-4c4f-95db-68089ed0f10d">Ley 2004, 157</xref>).
                        </p>

                </p>

                <p>Paul seems to have mastered this art of &#8220;island hopping,&#8221; of finding
                    a place in expatriate communities as a way of coping with growing up
                    transnationally. He is not alone. As my own descriptions of the spatial
                    practices of expatriate youths will demonstrate, this &#8220;island
                    hopping&#8221; that Ley describes is a very location-based practice involving
                    very concrete sites. </p>
                <p>Paul&#8217;s experience of mobility, shifting borders, and differences is one of
                    the most extreme among the expatriate youths I encountered. His situation of
                    living in China, being born in Brazil and speaking Portuguese at home, having
                    lived and been educated in the United States, yet being German according to his
                    passport are hard to grasp for me during our first encounter. Paul seems
                    unsurprised by my confusion and by being labeled differently depending on his
                    place of birth, country of upbringing, or passport. When we talk about his
                    private, Christian, American school in Shanghai, for instance, he mentions that,
                    including himself, only two Europeans are currently enrolled. Just hearing him
                    label himself &#8220;European&#8221; in a perfect American accent, when he has
                    never even lived in Europe, is surprising. Paul&#8217;s particularly flexible
                    way of positioning himself in terms of national or cultural identity clearly
                    depends on his point of reference (schooling, passport, family ties) and seems
                    to respond to different labels others appoint to him. </p>
                <p>How do young people like Paul deal with a frequently changing environment and how
                    do they manage such varied and shifting sources of cultural identity? This
                    ethnographic study addresses this question by exploring the everyday lives of
                    expatriate youths in general and Paul&#8217;s and his peers&#8217; own
                    perspectives in particular. I am interested in foreign students&#8217;
                    experiences of living abroad in Shanghai, their age-specific views on growing up
                    on the move, and their notions of &#8220;home.&#8221; Their stories raise
                    important questions about our understanding of national or cultural identity and
                    ways of belonging. Their experiences illustrate that common notions of either
                    are often too limited to capture the cultural complexities in the lives of
                    youths who have spent most of their childhood outside the country that issued
                    their passports. Some of them, like Paul, were born into a bi-national marriage
                    and, while living abroad, might wonder which of their parents&#8217; cultural
                    frameworks seems most applicable, or has had the most influence on them. Others
                    attend an international school that teaches in a language other than the one
                    they speak at home or in the streets, which requires a significant linguistic
                    flexibility. Still others have parents who have migrant backgrounds themselves.
                    Their children&#8217;s stories show that it is too simple to assume that, for
                    instance, a child born to Chinese parents in France, who is
                    &#8220;returning&#8221; to China and attending a French school, could simply
                    feel &#8220;Chinese.&#8221; Furthermore, someone who is fifteen and has moved
                    five times across national borders might question if a current place of
                    residence can actually still provide some form of belonging or cultural
                    identity. </p>
                <p>These scenarios show that Paul and his peers are, despite their youth, experts on
                    the effects and challenges of migration. By studying their stories and everyday
                    practices, I want to understand which competencies and strategies are important
                    for young people moving globally. In short, this ethnography traces what it
                    means to pass through Shanghai&#8212;to move to the city and leave it again
                    within a few years&#8212;and to actively cope with the experiences that go along
                    with it.</p>
                <p>Increasingly, expatriate communities and international schools around the globe
                    answer Paul&#8217;s and his peers&#8217; questions about the effects of moving
                    and negotiating cultural identity by referring to Pollock and Van Reken&#8217;s
                    ( <xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2969ca83-55a0-4ef2-98cf-fbe613a6cfe3">[1999] 2009</xref> ) concept of
                    &#8220;Third Culture Kids.&#8221; The concept addresses one aspect of expatriate
                    lives that my fieldwork and in-depth interviews with expatriate youths will also
                    reveal: despite all its privileges and opportunities, growing up &#8220;on the
                    move&#8221; and/or in a transient space demands that these children constantly
                    cope with changes, loss, and questions of belonging and identity. </p>

                    originally introduced by John Useem and Ruth Hill Useem in the 1950s (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8014e67f-9fb0-4fe2-af45-005aec388375">see Pollock and Van Reken [1999]

                    researchers described the parents&#8217; home culture as the first culture and
                    the culture of the place of residence as the second culture. &#8220;The
                    &#8216;Third Culture&#8217; to them was the culture of the expatriate community,
                    which they understood as a &#8216;culture between cultures&#8217; integrating
                    cultural features of home and host societies&#8221; (<xref rid="ID1193b8a0-bf93-4cb7-864b-b11504abd3d1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID10df8fca-1201-4fbc-b4a3-8f43cfdeb2cb">Kn&#246;rr 2005, 53</xref>).

                    popularity. Their work sets out to be a self-help book for members of expatriate

                <p>The findings of these studies, guidebooks, magazines, and websites (with a focus

                    represented as a group sharing many qualities, despite growing up in different
                    countries. Pollock and Van Reken ( <xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7fc642bd-af52-4b7d-b7ab-386c485d9480">[1999] 2009, 39</xref>) argue

                    concept. Based on such a notion of culture, Pollock and Van Reken see how the
                    children&#8217;s upbringing results in &#8220;the paradoxical nature of the TCK
                    experience&#8212;the sense of being profoundly connected yet simultaneously

                    are presented as central for TCKs. These problems, Pollock and Van Reken argue,

                    Concerning the relational patterns, the frequent experience of goodbyes,
                    according to Pollock and Van Reken, can sometimes lead to &#8220;patterns of
                    protecting themselves&#8221; (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID473af686-9981-42b7-b332-711e4a1a2075">ibid.,

                    greater lengths than some people might consider normal to nurture relational
                    ties with others&#8221; (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDac8ed2f8-9216-4598-bc68-30c533e5fbca">ibid.,
                        131</xref>). TCKs, according to them, place a high value on their
                    relationships and often jump into &#8220;deeper levels of relationship&#8221;
                        (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9a4681e3-5820-46be-abd1-3a5ea8b8f581">ibid., 136</xref>). Unresolved
                    grief is another issue that Pollock and Van Reken address, an issue that is
                    related to losses expatriate children experience by moving. However, these
                    losses are often hidden and unrecognized for a variety of reasons. The authors
                    also attest that an &#8220;uneven maturity&#8221; troubles TCKs. Although their
                    experience with TCKs often lead adults to view them as extremely mature&#8212;a
                    maturity and comfort level with adults that most TCKs also perceive in
                    themselves (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5a9381e9-f7ee-44a8-bf05-126ab3e589e5">ibid., 151</xref>), according to
                    Pollock and Van Reken&#8212;few spaces are available for TCKs &#8220;to test
                    rules during their teenage years&#8221; (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID09b596b6-90a1-47cf-a8ff-2bce91425113">ibid., 152</xref>). TCKs are
                    therefore often unsure of which norms to rebel against. This uncertainty can
                    lead to a postponed rebellion that usually manifests itself later, in college.
                    The benefits of TCK life, including the expanded worldview and the
                    well-developed skills mentioned above, are linked to the experience of
                    differences and having to learn how to deal with them through observation and
                    adaptation. </p>
                <p>Although it appeared in 1999, Pollock and Van Reken&#8217;s book is based on
                    surveys that were conducted in the early and mid-1980s with adults aged
                    twenty-two to twenty-seven, who were asked to reflect upon their childhood and
                    the impact that moving had on their lives. These &#8220;kids,&#8221; in other
                    words, were mainly born in the 1960s. Processes of globalization and the spread
                    and gaining influence of media and communication technologies have surely led to
                    changes in the experience of growing up abroad since then. More current results,
                    based on an online survey,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e122">4</xref> are
                    offered in the self-help book Expat Teens Talk (<xref rid="IDa0f13995-17e0-4d16-b9a6-2c70920ff106" ref-type="bibr" id="ID080e7ced-6310-40b3-a90d-4c2405d508a7">Pittman and Smit 2012</xref>).
                    The book collects answers from parents, counselors, and other TCKs to questions
                    the authors received from expat teens. Consequently, their approach only
                    presents advice with very limited insight into expatriate youths&#8217; daily
                    practices and social worlds. </p>
                <p>Such everyday experiences, however, explain how children and teenagers cope with
                    moving, and how they create world-views and ways of belonging within certain
                    communities, cultural environments, or nations. Paul, for instance, excitedly
                    talks about having met our common acquaintance Matthias during various nightlife
                    activities and how he eventually started hanging out with him. They became
                    friends, played music together, and founded a band which, however, no longer
                    exists, due to difficulties they had arranging practice sessions (the students
                    live one and a half hours apart by car or metro). It becomes clear, though, that
                    nightlife practices, hobbies, and friendships significantly impact Paul&#8217;s
                    and his fellow expatriate teenagers&#8217; Shanghai experiences. </p>

                    on expatriates into migration studies, so the argument goes, is necessary to
                    contest limited notions of migration processes and images of migrants. Although
                    many of these qualitative research projects take ethnic, racial, and
                    particularly gendered experiences of privileged migration into account, most
                    neglect the age-specific experiences of children and adolescents. With the

                    within the community and offer to help expatriate youths facing problems of
                    belonging and identity by establishing a feeling of community. Based on these
                    publications, the concept of TCK was also used and promoted in Shanghai&#8217;s
                    expatriate community centers and by school counselors. The author Ruth Van Reken
                    had even given a talk at Paul&#8217;s school. It is this reinforcement of the
                    sense of belonging to a special TCK, Global Nomad, or expat community that the
                    guidebooks and the talks in Shanghai promote that raised my awareness of
                    something I call &#8220;TCK nationalism.&#8221; This &#8220;TCK
                    nationalism&#8221; offers a simplified form of belonging for what is otherwise a
                    complex phenomenon and attracts individuals through its rhetoric, clear
                    definitions of insiders and outsiders, and feelings of superiority.</p>
                <p>Talking to Paul and other students, I find it difficult to see their flexible and
                    reflexive ways of negotiating identity as claiming clear belonging &#8220;in
                    relationship to others of similar background&#8221; (<xref rid="ID6bf98051-44f9-42d2-8caa-7fd9f958dee6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID865bfc54-4de2-4d3f-8273-aa9d9a10736b">see Pollock and Van Reken [1999]
                        2009, 19</xref>). In other words, as simply being a TCK. During our first
                    encounter, Paul seems to make very few claims of belonging at all. Home is a
                    rather vague idea to him which he reluctantly refers to as &#8220;wherever I am
                    staying.&#8221; When he describes his multi-local experiences, it is almost a
                    non-attachment to places and people that comes to the fore. This adjustable idea
                    of home also relates to his particularly flexible and ever-shifting way of
                    positioning himself in terms of cultural identity depending on the point of
                    reference. I argue that it is therefore clearly necessary to complicate and
                    critically reinvestigate the TCK issue outside of the guidebook phenomenon to
                    further understand Paul&#8217;s and other expatriate youths&#8217; ways of
                    situating and comprehending themselves in a world that is in constant flux.</p>

                    that lies in such concepts as Bhabha&#8217;s. However, as my own empirical focus
                    on privileged migration is too specific to meaningfully contribute to such a
                    broadening, and as the concept, in my view, still contains ideologies of
                    difference in its usage, I refrain from using it in this study.</p>

                    implicit&#8212;ideologies of difference will remain hidden; on the contrary,
                    depending on social status and origin, such differences clearly affect the
                    migration experience. &#8220;Global migration is far easier for highly-skilled
                    workers and those with capital than it is for those without training or

                    think that these adult retrospectives may often be linked to established

                    former research focusing on TCKs. Instead of inquiring into adult

                <p>The societal context of development has always been the focus of studies

                    tradition of the Chicago School and the British tradition of the Centre for
                    Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS), which opened in 1964 in Birmingham. US
                    sociologists focused on attempts to explain deviant activities. Interested in
                    crime, drug consumption, and gang membership, they looked for collective
                    normative behavior and moral codes specific to the groups studied (<xref rid="IDfdc4d8bf-6737-491d-8d1f-1d29dcb011e0" ref-type="bibr" id="ID77e609f7-a671-479c-a9e0-97050287cfb1">Hodkinson 2007, 3</xref>; <xref rid="ID0c25bbb4-67f7-427b-9674-b47c1dbed220" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbbebc9d5-050c-4102-b13f-f42206c238eb">Bucholtz 2002, 536</xref>).
                    These scholars regarded youth as a difficult liminal phase and delinquent youths
                    as victims and products of a deprived urban environment (<xref rid="ID1ae84f07-de3b-48ff-b321-3576b763c788" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb350b1f1-6bc9-44f2-9d74-ad24da94840e">Moser 2000, 17</xref>). While
                    the Chicago School took a strong ethnographic approach, the Birmingham School
                    favored the textual analysis of media and the semiotic analysis of cultural

                    represented an enactment of stylistic resistance; a subversive reaction by young

                    the cultural practices of young people today, observes that youth can be
                    understood as &#8220;a discursive construct expressing an increasingly varied
                    and, in many cases, conflicting range of political and aesthetic
                    sensibilities.&#8221; Contemporary cultural studies see the category of
                    &#8220;youth,&#8221; therefore, in contrast to definitions of
                    &#8220;adolescence&#8221; in developmental frameworks, as a &#8220;discursive
                    construct&#8221;&#8212;a perspective also found in popular discourse. Fuelled as
                    it is by the marketing of products and practices designed to help older adults
                    feel and look younger, today&#8217;s media shows that definitions of what it
                    means to be young are contested. Consequently, divisions in terms of leisure and
                    lifestyle preferences and practices across the generations become increasingly
                    less obvious (<xref rid="IDbd964410-1c08-4232-889e-f2edc9f820d2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3914848-81f0-49aa-af55-7fcd2046d852">Bennett 2007, 35</xref>).
                    Despite this fuzziness of the boundaries between youths and adults, Bennett
                    supports the utility of the term by convincingly arguing that differences
                    nevertheless remain. These differences manifest themselves &#8220;in terms of
                    youth's economic marginalisation and legal dependency, and in the responses of
                    the young and old to consumer goods and resultant patterns of taste and

                    anthropology&#8217;s tradition of researching adolescence still focuses on
                    change and development at the individual and cultural level. Its interest lies
                    in &#8220;the social staging of adolescence in particular cultural contexts in
                    which the universal developmental arc of adolescence is shaped by historically
                    speci&#64257;c processes of social, political, and economic transformation, as

                    criticizes these approaches because they are dominated by the teleology of the
                    developmental process from adolescence to adulthood. While she agrees that
                    developmental issues are certainly part of the study of youth, Bucholtz reminds
                    us that &#8220;the lived experience of young people is not limited to the uneasy
                    occupation of a developmental waystation en route to full-&#64258;edged cultural
                    standing. It also involves its own distinctive identities and practices, which
                    are neither rehearsals for the adult &#8216;real thing&#8217; nor even

                    various locations, such as school, urban street spaces, and night clubs. My
                    underlying conceptual understanding of youth as practice, performance, and
                    negotiation is new for studies of expatriate youth because, until now, most

                    study explores the experiences of families who have recently moved from the UK
                    to Australia. Her ethnographic account privileges the perspective of the
                    children in her study group, ages five to seventeen at the time of the
                    interviews, and discusses the ways in which they experienced and made sense of
                    the migration. Hutchins particularly analyzes the family&#8217;s decision-making
                    process prior to moving abroad and illustrates how different unspoken
                    conceptions of childhood influence this process, as parents often argue for
                    making decisions in their children&#8217;s &#8220;best interest.&#8221; As
                    &#8220;individual members of the family often have different interests,
                    [&#8230;] family migration decision-making is based upon a process of
                    negotiating individual influence and power within the family&#8221; (Hutchins

                    article lays open the use of parental power in these negotiations and
                    demonstrates how this power often results in the young actors&#8217; exclusion
                    from the decision-making process, Hutchins also identifies ways in which
                    children actively attempt to influence the decision or the overall migration
                    process. Hutchins&#8217; findings prompted me to discuss the events and
                    decisions that led to the move to Shanghai with Paul and his peers. Their
                    perspectives describe a lack of their involvement in this decision. Drinking
                    coffee on Wulumuqi Road, Paul tells me that he had not wanted to move to China
                    initially because he had not &#8220;even googled it before&#8221; and thought it
                    would be all &#8220;mud houses&#8221; and &#8220;bamboo forests.&#8221; He
                    remembers his father telling him about the move to China in a very
                    straightforward way: </p>

                    contributes to the youths&#8217; initial reluctance to relocate to China and

                    of return migration and presents, through innovative fieldwork on domestic
                    spaces in Britain, the experiences of &#8220;children as equal movers.&#8221;
                    The actors of her study are between seven and seventeen years old. They are
                    members of households headed by a highly skilled migrant and have returned
                    &#8220;home&#8221; to Britain after living in Singapore. Her work explores how
                    the children in her study understood and negotiated this return. Additionally,
                    by drawing on photography by the children, she highlights the significance of
                    their everyday routines and demonstrates children&#8217;s specific home-making
                    practices, which she often finds more &#8220;mobile, transient and
                    smaller-scale&#8221; than those of adults. Based on Hatfield&#8217;s insights,
                    Part III, Chapter 2 of this work discusses expatriate students&#8217;
                    home-making processes in Shanghai in more detail.</p>
                <p>Inspired by these case studies and the recent shift in youth studies&#8212;from
                    an emphasis on development to a focus on cultural practices and discursive
                    understandings of youth&#8212;this ethnography investigates expatriate
                    youths&#8217; everyday activities and focuses on their own narratives. By
                    understanding age as a collective identity and not as a trajectory, I privilege
                    the experiences of the &#8220;here-and&#8211;now&#8221; over the process of
                    development. In order to capture these age-specific experiences, my work,
                    despite its focus on the lifestyle that comes with a particular mobility, mainly
                    addresses everyday routines at school, at leisure sites, or at home. The focus
                    on the youths&#8217; own perspectives and experiences that informs my approach
                    has led to many passages in this ethnography in which the students&#8217;
                    experiences are described through their own words and testimonies. This
                    framework means that I focus on the youth&#8217;s relations with each other
                    rather than their relations with adults. I am well aware that their relations to
                    their parents and other adults might hereby be underrepresented. Nevertheless, I
                    think overcoming the &#8220;adult bias&#8221; and understanding the
                    youth&#8217;s own perspectives will contribute to the larger picture of
                    privileged migration. </p>
                <p>My choice of terminology reflects the outlined developments in the study of youth
                    and adapts them for the purposes of this book. I use the term
                    &#8220;youth&#8221; or &#8220;youths,&#8221; &#8220;young people,&#8221; or the
                    age-specific term &#8220;teenagers,&#8221; and not the term
                    &#8220;adolescent.&#8221; The latter implies a narrow developmental framework,
                    which I reject for my work. I acknowledge processes of development, but regard
                    transformation, change, and learning as something that is present not only in
                    youths&#8217; lives, but for everyone. Because I worked with youths that were
                    enrolled at Shanghai&#8217;s numerous international schools, I also refer to my
                    research participants as &#8220;students.&#8221; Furthermore, I occasionally use
                    the term &#8220;children,&#8221; not in contrast to &#8220;adult,&#8221; but in
                    juxtaposition to &#8220;parents&#8221;&#8212;an understanding similar to
                    Hatfield&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID0e2fbbf1-4841-435d-8caf-51940061c269" ref-type="bibr" id="ID45230ece-69fc-49e1-90d8-d326d3dff5c5">2010,
                    247</xref>). I have done so to underline the young people&#8217;s dependency: at
                    the time of my fieldwork, all of the actors of my study still lived with one or
                    both parents. The term &#8220;expatriate,&#8221; or its short form
                    &#8220;expat,&#8221; is suited for my work because the student interviewees at
                    the international high schools in Shanghai all identified with it, regardless of
                    their parents&#8217; occupations, nationalities, or migration trajectories.
                    &#8220;Expat&#8221; can therefore be seen as a term that refers to a shared set
                    of practices and privileges.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e280">10</xref>
                </p>
                <p>One more conceptual dimension needs to be addressed. While &#8220;expatriate
                    youth&#8221; is a suitable replacement of the TCK label for this particular
                    study, it does not offer any insights as an analytical concept with which to
                    investigate Paul&#8217;s and other international students&#8217; mediations of
                    cultural complexities. For this I have to turn towards the notion of
                    transculturality and related ideas.</p>

                    transculturality or transculturation is not a &#8220;given&#8221; concept but
                    has its own conceptual history. Since the philosopher Wolfgang Welsch coined the
                    term &#8220;transculturality&#8221; (<xref rid="ID491867c4-2968-4eb2-87ac-bc12005653ec" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc3b4c6de-172e-4ce5-b15e-47468b01a72d">Welsch 1999</xref>), a
                    burgeoning field has developed into an interdisciplinary pursuit that scholars

                    &#8220;transculturality&#8221; to challenge the classical idea of singular
                    cultures and more recent concepts of interculturality and multiculturality. He
                    strongly criticizes these concepts and has argued that cultures are not
                    &#8220;constituted in the form of islands or spheres&#8221; (<xref rid="ID491867c4-2968-4eb2-87ac-bc12005653ec" ref-type="bibr" id="ID12976c6e-63cc-4753-b43a-fcdd56fc7bf0">1999</xref>, 197). The idea of
                    transculturality, according to Welsch, can solve the misconception that cultures
                    have &#8220;the insinuated form of homogeneity and separateness&#8221; (<xref rid="ID491867c4-2968-4eb2-87ac-bc12005653ec" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb2688815-36d7-4b41-81d3-13b281a11b43">ibid.</xref>). The concept of
                    transculturality, Welsch argues, &#8220;sketches a different picture of the
                    relation between cultures. Not one of isolation and of conflict, but one of
                    entanglement, intermixing and commonness&#8221; (<xref rid="ID491867c4-2968-4eb2-87ac-bc12005653ec" ref-type="bibr" id="IDff137264-5925-4076-8517-fda747435f01">ibid.</xref>). Furthermore,
                    Welsch also acknowledges transculturality not only on society&#8217;s macro
                    level, but also on the individual level: &#8220;Work on one&#8217;s identity is
                    becoming more and more work on the integration of components of differing

                    cultural identity they pursue is based on the underlying premise that certain

                    explore, examine and infiltrate new, seemingly alien cultures&#8221; and that
                    these experiences show that &#8220;it will become increasingly difficult to

                    societies, and forge new, hybrid narratives of identity for themselves, without

                    that transculturality offers an identity model through which TCKs can be
                    understood. Her work combines the popular concept of TCKs with a theoretical
                    interpretation of transculturality. Richter draws on Welsch&#8217;s concept and
                    understands transculturality mainly as &#8220;jenseits des Gegensatzes von

                    argues that TCKs encounter diverse cultural elements, bridge several cultures,
                    and are marked by being part of a third, newly-formed culture. Consequently,
                    Richter argues that TCKs represent and articulate different cultures,

                    understanding of homogeneity. This tendency stems from Welsch&#8217;s
                    understanding of transculturality, according to which cultures have a
                    &#8220;core&#8221; (Kern). As Brosius and Wenzlhuemer (<xref rid="ID47fb070b-06af-46ae-99f6-b872933e33bb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID13e495f8-b007-4973-b8db-89ef77209117">2011, 11</xref>) argue,
                    &#8220;the matter is even more complicated since we must reflect on the role of
                    local notions of, for example, beauty, authenticity, or realism without
                    essentialising them.&#8221; </p>
                <p>For my analysis, the terms &#8220;transculturalist,&#8221; &#8220;TCK,&#8221; and
                    &#8220;transcultural personalities&#8221; are too static because they presuppose
                    a specific, mixed identity that is in opposition to fixed
                    &#8220;authentic&#8221; others. Processes of cultural identity negotiations,
                    however, are flexible, relational, and situational. My work does follow
                    Richter&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID671061a8-8f79-452a-919c-7820aa5316f4" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb058b2f3-6251-43f5-9072-a2e5d6f71ac2">2011</xref>)

                    transculturality. However, my ethnographic approach goes beyond Richter&#8217;s
                    account, which is based on established narratives of people who label themselves
                    as TCKs, by including practices that contradict or impair the building of the
                    &#8220;transcultural personalities&#8221; that Richter sees. To analyze such
                    contradicting practices&#8212;for instance the retreat from urban China to
                    comfortable and familiar expatriate enclaves in Shanghai&#8212;it is necessary
                    to go beyond Welsch&#8217;s notion of transculturality as a state of being. </p>
                <p>In contrast, transculturality&#8217;s dynamic processes have received more
                    attention from authors such as Fernando Ortiz, whose early writings on what he
                    termed &#8220;transculturation&#8221; were seemingly unknown to Welsch when he
                    coined his term. Ortiz developed the concept of transculturation in the 1940s,
                    in his work Cuban Counterpoint: Tobacco and Sugar (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6e56c06d-7ba7-4445-b924-6e7c76d6ec71">Ortiz 1970</xref>), which
                    analyzes the production of these crops in Cuba. Based on empirical evidence,
                    Ortiz describes the rapid global spread of tobacco farming and assesses the
                    reasons for its change in &#8220;social significance as it passed from the
                    cultures of the New World to those of the Old.&#8221; He calls this process
                    &#8220;the transculturation of tobacco&#8221; (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfd7cb4d2-af7f-4a94-8b18-de5cb560b7c6">ibid., 183</xref>) and argues
                    that transculturation defines what he saw as &#8220;the highly varied phenomena
                    that have come about in Cuba as a result of the extremely complex transmutations
                    of culture that have taken place here&#8221; (<xref rid="ID03d63e70-9045-4c69-b0c1-4590a9b173f6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID5388a9c9-18e6-44e1-96a4-db0f00179558">ibid., 98</xref>). The term, he
                    claims, more adequately describes these historical events than the term
                    &#8220;acculturation,&#8221; which had been frequently employed until then to

                    the introduction to Ortiz&#8217;s book, supports the term and claims that
                    &#8220;acculturation&#8221; is &#8220;an ethnocentric word&#8221; that connotes
                    the idea that &#8220;the &#8216;uncultured&#8217; is to receive the benefits of
                    &#8216;our culture&#8217;.&#8221; He argues that &#8220;by the use of the term
                    acculturation we implicitly introduce a series of moral, normative, and
                    evaluative concepts which radically vitiate the real understanding of the

                    Ortiz&#8217;s concept of transculturation emphasizes the creative processes of

                <p>Many of Paul and his peers&#8217; spatial practices that I will discuss

                    cultural boundaries of gated communities and international schools. Their forms

                    their need to improve their (transcultural) understanding in various contexts.
                    Nadig shows that, in cultural studies and psychoanalysis, similar

                    individual, self-reflective narratives of Paul and other teenagers I met include
                    such mediations. While some students negotiate between differences they perceive
                    between their parents and themselves, others mediate between school and home, or

                    are also strategic elements in such identity negotiations. Writing about
                    entrepreneurs of Turkish origin in Berlin, he sees transculturality as practice.
                    This concept explains and resolves a contradiction between the theoretical
                    standpoint that homogeneous cultures do not exist on the one hand, and the
                    everyday use and experience of signs and practices that permanently (re)produce
                    such essentializations of fixed, homogenous cultures, on the other. P&#252;tz
                    does not consider cultural embeddedness to be something fixed, but argues that
                    it is created through communicative practices in a specific situation and is
                    thus open to change (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3d7b1947-0cf2-4794-b8d7-5ce4bf05f39d">ibid.,

                    an individual&#8217;s social practice but understands these systems as forming a
                    &#8220;repertoire&#8221; to which the individual has access and from which he or

                    such an interpretative and symbolic understanding of culture, P&#252;tz&#8217;s
                    concept of transculturality as practice begs the question of why cultural
                    boundaries are drawn (P&#252;tz <xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID910ccb01-799b-48e0-824a-368a983af9ec">2004</xref>, 11), rather than
                    inquiring about the state of seemingly homogenous cultures. Concepts of
                    transculturality allow for individuals to articulate belonging to different
                    imagined communities in whose construction processes they are permanently

                    self-positioning on both sides of certain borders can, according to
                    P&#252;tz&#8217;s view, be seen as the ability of individuals to deal flexibly

                    maintains that, with the help of the concept of transculturality, the
                    inner-outer differentiation that comes with every border is conceptually shifted
                    onto the individual. Furthermore, P&#252;tz sees transculturality as an
                    observational concept (Beobachtungskonzept) (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID51716eae-ef52-44f4-9bae-781eade1e61e">ibid., 13</xref>) or analyzing

                    a useful tool for sharpening one&#8217;s focus and shedding light on the
                    cultural aspects of practices, their borders, and their entanglements.

                <p>P&#252;tz defines transculturality as a certain practice of specific subjects,
                    which can be divided into &#8220;everyday transculturality&#8221; and
                    &#8220;strategic transculturality&#8221; (<xref rid="ID2f666166-ab0d-47eb-8165-ee3aebfff824" ref-type="bibr" id="ID2a55e2a5-2dc9-44d8-9070-7dd0aeba4365">ibid., 13</xref>) and describes
                    the former as concrete routines with which the subjects are able to position
                    themselves in different frames of reference (Deutungsschemata). If these frames
                    of reference are reflected upon by their actors and used intentionally,
                    &#8220;everyday transculturality&#8221; becomes &#8220;strategic

                </p>
                <p>This competence in &#8220;milieu moving&#8221; is, for instance, illustrated by
                    one of the students I met in Shanghai, Xia, who was raised in Germany by his
                    Chinese parents, and who describes how alternating between his German school in
                    Shanghai and his home forces him to alter his role, speech, and behavior to suit
                    each location. Such a self-reflective practice of strategic transculturality
                    also enables us to understand Paul&#8217;s way of labeling himself differently
                    in regards to nationality, as he did during our talk on Wulumuqi Road. This
                    becomes even clearer when we meet again a few months later in Germany. Triggered
                    by leaving Shanghai and his move to Germany, he suddenly labels himself
                    Brazilian. It is a strategic decision based on his judgment of what actually
                    might be accepted and confirmed by others in his new situation. Paul expresses
                    no worries about his recent choice to move to Germany after graduating and
                    stresses his ability to adapt anywhere&#8212;especially as his private,
                    English-language university provides another international &#8220;bubble.&#8221;
                    During this second interview in Germany, he conveys a calmness and
                    effortlessness about his many relocations&#8212;and his recent move to Germany
                    in particular&#8212;before he suddenly tells me he considers himself Brazilian,
                    now, even though he only lived in Brazil until he was six years old. I am
                    surprised by his new choice of cultural identity. While I wonder whether my
                    presence makes him feel obliged to make a statement of belonging, he lists his
                    very pragmatic reasons for this choice by explaining why his other places of
                    upbringing are unsuitable to define him: he simply does not want to identify
                    himself as American and, given the way he looks, he cannot be Chinese. </p>
                <p>Paul&#8217;s way of thinking about and rationally arguing for his current
                    cultural identity in Germany can clearly be seen as strategic in Robert

                    for self-reflective actors who continuously (and sometimes strategically)
                    re-position themselves by drawing from their &#8220;cultural repertoire&#8221;

                    simultaneously adding to this &#8220;repertoire&#8221; more convincing than the

                    mediations between inner/individual and outer/cultural realities (Nadig <xref rid="ID02aa130d-9288-4123-8a87-6939ae5ef1d3" ref-type="bibr" id="ID21936613-78d1-4965-a5e3-d62a059af811">2004</xref>), I suggest framing

                    processes when speaking of transcultural perspectives. By using the term
                    &#8220;perspectives,&#8221; I additionally emphasize the idea of
                    self-reflexivity, the ability to focus and reflect on the processes that
                    manifest our understandings of &#8220;cultures&#8221; and their boundaries. For
                    this reason, I agree with Brosius&#8217; assertion that transculturality also
                    serves as a heuristic device (<xref rid="ID1aead012-70be-4e04-a271-90e97aff38ae" ref-type="bibr" id="IDab921f0b-7b1e-4f70-97ed-3760322b04ce">Brosius 2011,

                <p>Based on my accounts of 43 expatriate youths in Shanghai in 2010, 2011, and 2012,
                    I show that many of these students, especially those born of bicultural
                    marriages or to parents with migrant biographies, develop such a transcultural
                    perspective toward their own lives, a perspective that is highly self-reflective
                    upon their mobility and position, and the influence that family, the school
                    environment, or Shanghai has on them. The term &#8220;perspective,&#8221; which
                    is common in transcultural studies, was even explicitly used by one student who
                    was already mentioned, Xia&#8212;the son of Chinese parents, who grew up in
                    Germany and was enrolled at a German school&#8212;to describe his challenges and
                    desire to cope with such variations in his immediate environment. Despite the
                    fact that my presence might have triggered some of the students&#8217;
                    reflections and influenced them accordingly, I argue that transculturality as a
                    method or specific perspective is not only reserved for the anthropologist or
                    the academic, but is a form of reflection acquired by many of the teenagers who
                    shared their experiences with me. Many students develop such self-reflexivity
                    about their own entanglement as a coping strategy for a lifestyle of constant
                    moving, whether it is they or their close friends who move.</p>
                <p>This transcultural perspective on their own lives may at first seem to contradict
                    the youths&#8217; everyday spatial practices of demarcation, such as
                    Paul&#8217;s bubble. However, spatial demarcations and transcultural
                    perspectives actually go hand-in-hand. The students&#8217; own mobility can
                    evoke a desire for stability on the one hand and a desire to broaden their point
                    of view in order to manage the changes they experience on the other. Living on
                    the move by no means erases but instead often provokes the desire to create
                    familiar spaces, to settle despite having to face the next move. Thus a constant
                    negotiation takes place between drawing boundaries and crossing them. </p>
                <p>When applied by the researcher, a transcultural perspective sheds light on how
                    these youths shift and merge different cultural practices, positions, and
                    creative formations of new subjectivities. It can also serve to inform moments
                    of boundary-drawing and practices of making distinctions.</p>
                <p>During the interviews, I get the impression that Paul, like me, has difficulty
                    grasping the full breadth of the changes he has experienced throughout his
                    lifetime. Instead of describing or contemplating these differences that he
                    experiences like the other students, Paul simply describes what has helped him
                    to emplace himself: the social worlds of &#8220;bubbles.&#8221; It is thus
                    impossible to understand the &#8220;transcultural turbulences&#8221; (<xref rid="ID47fb070b-06af-46ae-99f6-b872933e33bb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7f01e276-d7b1-4b0a-b07d-85be9c3ae89c">Brosius and Wenzlhuemer

                    cultural identity by people like Paul, without a more detailed ethnographic
                    investigation into the &#8220;production of difference within common, shared,

                    focus on the shifting and transgression of boundaries require detailed
                    ethnographic insights into the production of cultural differences at specific
                    sites. For this reason, I chose to investigate expatriate youths&#8217; spatial

                <p>To further understand expatriate youths&#8217; everyday lives and their
                    collective and cultural identity performances, I studied their spatial practices
                    in Shanghai. Drawing on the research tradition of urban anthropology,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e369">12</xref> my work therefore examines specific
                    places favored by expatriate youths and connects them to their experience of
                    Shanghai as a rising mega-city, as well as to their memories of places
                    elsewhere. With this emphasis, I not only contribute to filling the gap of
                    research on geographies of youth that scholars have recently turned to (e.g. the
                    founding of the journal Children&#8217;s Geographies), but also attune my work
                    to methodologies in ethnographic studies that foreground the importance of place

                <p>While ethnographic fieldwork is usually tied to the idea of &#8220;being
                    there,&#8221; it is less clear what and when &#8220;there&#8221; means and what
                    we can actually call &#8220;the field.&#8221; This is particularly true when
                    studying phenomena of migration. The lives of the individuals
                    researched&#8212;as I will show throughout this ethnography&#8212;are tied to
                    and embedded in many locales and diverse transnational spaces. Katie Walsh

                    &#8220;Finally, there is a tension, evident in ethnographies of transnationalism
                    and globalization more generally, that is connected to the difficulties of
                    trying to use single-site research to trace the mobile practices of
                    transnationalism in everyday life&#8221; (Walsh <xref rid="IDada3c572-55e7-4abd-83fb-08d88fd01d32" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1a7bd495-2715-4b39-a924-d626a4c26063">2010</xref>, 140). </p>
                <p>In line with such criticism of single-sited research, I was often asked why I did

                    approach: &#8220;Ultimately, both [single- and multi-sited approaches] are
                    partial because both have their self-/imposed limits. Multi-sited ethnography is
                    no more holistically inclined than its predessor [sic]&#8221; (<xref rid="ID44e974ca-05ca-4942-be0e-e108cd171049" ref-type="bibr" id="ID95c65b18-9d4d-4519-aa13-b8d666ac2f07">ibid., 13</xref>).</p>
                <p>Despite focusing exclusively on Shanghai, my work is informed by the strong
                    global connections across multiple and large spatial scales that are part of
                    expatriate youth&#8217;s everyday lives. Expatriate children have often already
                    moved several times. The continuous presence of these places in the
                    students&#8217; lives is obvious not only in narratives of migration
                    experiences, but particularly through the constant comparison of Shanghai to
                    former places of residence. Furthermore, daily practices involve memories of
                    other places that are constantly evoked through material connections (clothes or
                    furniture bought elsewhere), sensuous experiences (food from home), and
                    emotional paraphernalia (a postcard or an email from a close friend abroad).

                <p>Robinson&#8217;s approach helps us to understand that, for the students in my

                    tied to that which is elsewhere.</p>
                <p>By acknowledging the continuous presence of other places in our daily lives, as
                    it arises through the global circulation of people, images, technology, goods,
                    money, and ideas&#8212;which anthropologist Arjun Appadurai (<xref rid="ID854192fc-caff-486c-8097-c43ba1ba60f5" ref-type="bibr" id="IDab28494f-4b70-426e-bf38-84e8138042fc">1996</xref>) has conceptualized
                    as ethno-, media-, techno-, finance-, and ideoscapes&#8212;we can observe that
                    global cultural flows touch down in specific sites. For children on the move
                    with their expatriate parents, this means that, although they may grow up
                    transnationally, they always live somewhere particular, if only for a limited
                    time. Brenda Yeoh and Katie Willis (<xref rid="ID9b7b1b37-2a0a-40cb-9238-4a4a730dd687" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1ff6e496-86b8-4329-8cf6-150d8213cbc8">2005, 270</xref>) point out that
                    &#8220;transnational elites belong as much to the &#8216;space of place&#8217;
                    as to the &#8216;space of flows&#8217;,&#8221; and so do their children.
                    Choosing to ground my research in Shanghai, I therefore decided not to focus on
                    the links of one expatriate community to another, or the relations of family
                    members dispersed across the globe, but rather to see how these global
                    connections are negotiated in the everyday spaces of expatriate youths.</p>
                <p>Consequently, my methodological approach follows those concepts of ethnography
                    that promote the idea of grounding ethnographic research in particular sites, as
                    scholars such as Zsuzsa Gille and Se&#225;n &#211; Riain (<xref rid="ID1357689e-b37d-406e-9dd5-c5f9c197d2e1" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4df13a03-ce57-4b90-935d-d0f80501cacd">2002</xref>) or Harri Englund

                    These approaches argue that focusing on specific places enables us to gain
                    insight into the global networks of each site&#8217;s actors: &#8220;We have
                    argued for a global ethnography that still locates itself firmly in places but
                    which conceives of those places as themselves globalized with multiple external
                    connections, porous and contested boundaries, and social relations that are
                    constructed across multiple spatial scales&#8221; (Gille and &#211; Riain <xref rid="ID1357689e-b37d-406e-9dd5-c5f9c197d2e1" ref-type="bibr" id="IDaa7a0644-965a-4fe7-b063-dc6f55770824">2002</xref>, 290&#8211;291).</p>
                <p>Similar to Gille and &#211; Riain&#8217;s suggested perspectives on specific
                    places as &#8220;globalized with multiple external connections,&#8221; Englund
                    promotes a methodological focus on sites in recognition of their global
                    connections. Englund (<xref rid="IDdfffd6ec-86da-443a-a030-3956065998eb" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe386d20d-9ab6-4c33-b865-3832f26006b1">2002,

                    &#8220;postglobalist&#8221; perspective that works with the idea of
                    &#8220;emplacement&#8221;&#8212;a term anthropologist David Howes (<xref rid="ID765f705e-646d-4074-897d-17cc9de86205" ref-type="bibr" id="ID36ae0fcd-ec9e-4dfc-bbc2-63b97bc710ce">[2005]2006, 7</xref>) later

                    to situatedness in a globalized world. Englund&#8217;s perspective enables an

                    places:</p>

                            existence and transformation. Even the apparently most global phenomenon
                            is continuously emplaced as it reaches its new destinations. As such,
                            localization is doubly disqualified to capture the contours of
                            emplacement. Not only does it evoke globalization as its logical
                            opposite, it also conveys a sense of closure in local appropriations. If
                            persons, institutions, and capital are always emplaced, the challenge is
                            to understand the variable capacities of places to act as springboards

                    postglobalist perspective supports my focus on Shanghai and the various specific
                    locales within it. The methodological approaches by Gille and &#211; Riain as
                    well as Englund, however, prompt a consideration of the global connections these
                    places are part of: &#8220;Not only is the so-called local an emergent property
                    of nonlocal processes, the so-called global also requires particular sites and
                    terrains to operate&#8221; (Englund <xref rid="ID6fce4856-599d-456d-8470-5d55ef3086c0" ref-type="bibr" id="ID276fc1ee-be92-4e6f-adae-fe9a94ffcd35">2002</xref>, 266). Willis, Yeoh,

                    out how this principle works within expatriate spheres: &#8220;Transnational
                    elites may be evidence of processes at a global scale, but this
                    &#8216;global&#8217; is constructed and understood by operations of particular
                    individuals in local spaces.&#8221; A postglobalist perspective is thus useful
                    for my research because it enables an understanding of expatriate youths&#8217;
                    ways of life not only as the outcome of globalization, but sees these
                    individuals as mobile yet emplaced actors.</p>
                <p>To understand their experience of specific places in Shanghai further, my
                    research on spatial practices is also theoretically informed by Howes&#8217;s
                        (<xref rid="ID765f705e-646d-4074-897d-17cc9de86205" ref-type="bibr" id="ID87473bb9-75e8-424a-9dd9-3b809a32b696">[2005] 2006</xref>) idea of
                    &#8220;emplacement&#8221; that I mentioned above. His concept of emplacement
                    encourages paying particular attention to a variety of sensory impressions and
                    enables us to recognize and highlight the importance of physical and emotional
                    experiences in specific places. I therefore understand emplacement as the
                    process of engaging with the &#8220;here and now.&#8221;</p>
                <p>Furthermore, ethnographer and filmmaker David MacDougall&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID0a39d5fd-2b51-4ac7-975f-35c0f65345d7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID331cb464-67a0-4801-8b3e-d230e5511f2a">2006</xref>) notion of
                    &#8220;social aesthetics&#8221; is helpful in highlighting the sensorial and
                    embodied experiences of the youths&#8217; preferred spaces in Shanghai. He
                    suggests paying attention to specific objects, such as &#8220;the design of
                    buildings and grounds&#8221; or &#8220;the use of clothing and colors,&#8221;
                    and daily practices, &#8220;for instance the organization of students&#8217;
                    time,&#8221; to understand the &#8220;social aesthetics&#8221; of an environment

                    understanding the &#8220;social aesthetic field&#8221; as a coalescence of
                    different elements such as &#8220;objects and actions&#8221; (<xref rid="ID0a39d5fd-2b51-4ac7-975f-35c0f65345d7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID27459747-32d2-4604-99e1-ac9d8d7653c7">2006, 98</xref>), we can then
                    analyze it by focusing on a specific community, its material environment, and
                    the quotidian practices that occur within it. Social aesthetics are &#8220;both
                    the backdrop and product of everyday life&#8221; (<xref rid="ID0a39d5fd-2b51-4ac7-975f-35c0f65345d7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4bde5f65-9d65-489f-b8f4-a26824bc466c">ibid., 108</xref>).
                    MacDougall&#8217;s notion directly relates to my own fieldwork experience. For
                    example, the aforementioned concept explains how the social aesthetics of a
                    classroom (the room&#8217;s shape, lighting, and seating arrangements, which for
                    students are intertwined with specific behavioral rules) can influence the range
                    or depth of topics of the interviews I conducted at the students&#8217; schools.
                    In these discussions, school-related issues were elaborated upon more than
                    leisure activities. MacDougall&#8217;s idea of social aesthetics thus helps us
                    to further understand how the materiality and atmosphere of select places can
                    foster certain practices or discussions among the youths, whether it be the
                    school premises (Part III, Chapter 3) that evokes a certain behavior and
                    conversation topics, or a nightclub (Part IV, Chapter 2) that promotes certain
                    ways of dressing up. It demonstrates the students&#8217; active involvement in
                    creating their own spaces as well as their roles in shaping Shanghai as a world
                    city and stage for their own identity performances. </p>
                <p>Youth culture scholar Andy Bennett (<xref rid="IDe2e3ffe5-b295-4bf3-ae4f-624de580b6fa" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6e4a06ce-fc7b-4dd5-ac81-6524fe5b20f8">2000</xref>) shows that locality
                    continues to play a role as &#8220;a relatively stable base for otherwise
                    unstable and transient [&#8230;] identities&#8221; (<xref rid="IDfdc4d8bf-6737-491d-8d1f-1d29dcb011e0" ref-type="bibr" id="ID053cda4f-7a70-44e6-b97e-602c301c4ca5">Hodkinson 2007, 12</xref>). To
                    understand how expatriate youths shape and use specific spaces as a source for
                    identity and age performances in more detail, I also draw on geographer Doreen
                    Massey&#8217;s (<xref rid="IDecf4bd22-e3a0-475e-911e-54a1599534fb" ref-type="bibr" id="IDea8e451e-bf27-48e5-8faa-734bf1cae8c0">1995,
                    204</xref>) argument that &#8220;space and place are never just the physicality
                    of plans and bricks and mortar,&#8221; but &#8220;products of our social
                    interactions and imaginations,&#8221; which we construct &#8220;in a constant
                    negotiation with each other.&#8221; Space and identity constructions are
                    reciprocal. Massey (<xref rid="IDa5084c47-3253-43ee-b205-5907d7dd1a8d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID71d5d237-e64f-426a-8536-6ad720a3c2a2">1998</xref>) has
                    shown that this is particularly true for age identities. This correspondence is
                    striking when looking at spatial ordering within populations, for example, which
                    individuals are allowed on a playground vs. a cinema or bar, and which are not.
                    As Massey notes, &#8220;indeed the very drawing of age lines and the definition
                    of the spaces where particular age groups are allowed is part of the process of
                    defining an age group in the first place. The control of spatiality is part of
                    the process of defining the social category of &#8216;youth&#8217; itself&#8221;
                        (<xref rid="IDa5084c47-3253-43ee-b205-5907d7dd1a8d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID168ce52c-cbbd-4fb1-a6be-f64770550916">Massey 1998, 129</xref>).
                    Massey&#8217;s argument of reciprocity thus helped me to analyze how these
                    particular teenagers&#8217; identity constructions and their typical
                    performances were related to specific locations in the city of Shanghai.</p>
                <p>In summary, in addition to focusing on cultural identity negotiations and
                    youths&#8217; age-specific perspectives, my third theoretical and methodological
                    focus analyzes expatriate youths&#8217; everyday spatial practices and their
                    (dis)engagement with the &#8220;local&#8221; to find out what role
                    &#8220;place&#8221; plays in their lives on the move. This is not an attempt to
                    understand culture geographically. Rather, by following approaches in
                    post-global ethnography, I aim to highlight how these teenagers embed different
                    global elements in a host of particularities. Examining physical experiences of
                    particular places in Shanghai provides a foundation for the overall experience
                    of mobility that this ethnography traces.</p>

                <p>Paul&#8217;s story exemplifies how entangled expatriate youths&#8217; positions
                    toward their cultural identities can be. To gain a detailed understanding of
                    such processes of positioning and forms of belonging, this ethnography will
                    illustrate international youths&#8217; subjective and collective experiences and
                    ways of managing migration processes. It will chronologically delineate the
                    expatriate students&#8217; experiences of the decision to move, their arrival,
                    ways of life and how they rationalize their stay, as well as the moment of
                    leaving and moving on. Following this central narrative, the transit space of
                    Shanghai will unfold successively, affording insights into its various spaces
                    and meanings for expatriate youths. This book will also highlight how the
                    majority of the teenagers in Shanghai understand it as a temporary or transitory
                    space, and a liminal phase in their lives, or, as my seventeen-year-old
                    interviewee Giovanni, who had been living in Shanghai for three years at the
                    time of the interview, described it: &#8220;You are only here for a temporary
                    period; like a long vacation.&#8221; This book will follow, capture, and
                    conceptualize this experience of &#8220;passing through,&#8221; of transient
                    emplacement.</p>
                <p>To understand this experience in more depth, my ethnography will center on three
                    main aspects, the theoretical foundations of which I have laid out in this
                    introduction: the process of cultural identity negotiation, the age-specific
                    experience of expatriation, and the role of places in a life on the move. This
                    book therefore seeks answers to the following questions: How can we understand
                    these mobile youths in terms of cultural identity? How do youths experience the
                    move to Shanghai and how does their age shape that experience? And, finally,
                    what roles do specific places and the city of Shanghai play in their globally
                    connected lives? In addressing these questions, the individual chapters will
                    focus on various aspects of the lives of young expatriates.</p>
                <p>Part I, &#8220;Getting Acquainted,&#8221; introduces the international youths
                    whose lifestyles and world views I examine. It also depicts how I, as a
                    researcher, approached and encountered expatriate students in Shanghai. The part
                    opens with a summary of the general situation and size of the expatriate
                    communities in Shanghai. Insights into the daily routines of international
                    school life and portrayals of two peer groups follow, before I introduce the
                    individual experiences of four expatriate teenagers. </p>
                <p>Part II, &#8220;Leaving,&#8221; provides the youths&#8217; retrospectives of the
                    circumstances that led to their relocation to Shanghai. Chapter 1 shows that
                    many of the teenagers felt they were denied an active role in the
                    decision-making process regarding the move and were often reluctant or initially
                    even against the idea of moving abroad. Connected to discussions about leaving,
                    Chapter 2 delineates the emotional challenges of moving to Shanghai. Based on
                    the students&#8217; commentary, it identifies their &#8220;culture shock,&#8221;
                    their reaction to an unfamiliar urban environment, new sensory impressions, and
                    a lack of friends and extended family, as well as problems within the family
                    related to the move. The different experiences of youths all underline that the
                    times of leaving and arriving&#8212;or what Ahmed, Casta&#241;eda, Fortier, and

                <p>Part III, &#8220;Arriving,&#8221; describes students&#8217; everyday practices
                    upon arrival in Shanghai and their agency in making Shanghai their new home and
                    community. Chapter 1 presents different students&#8217; ways of making sense of
                    their new urban environment, not just in terms of navigation and sensorial
                    experiences, but also in terms of positioning themselves within the city. It
                    demonstrates that managing the city means managing everyday life and the
                    experience of migration, for instance by learning how to navigate between spaces
                    of everyday practices and consumption, by giving spaces a social meaning, or by
                    dividing Shanghai into familiar areas and &#8220;the city.&#8221; Chapter 2 is
                    concerned with practices and notions of home. After providing a detailed
                    description of expatriate housing spaces&#8212;gated communities&#8212;it
                    identifies youths&#8217; small-scale home-making practices, such as room
                    decorating or family dinners, as well as larger processes of locating
                    &#8220;home(s)&#8221; in their transnational networks. It demonstrates that, due
                    to the expatriate teenagers&#8217; experiences of mobility, &#8220;home&#8221;
                    is a fluid concept with no single location and is simultaneously tied to various
                    places, items, and people. It becomes evident that making and (re)imagining
                    home(s), or collecting material goods to produce a sense of belonging, helps
                    these teenagers to manage feelings of loneliness. For a deeper understanding of
                    these practices and the notion of &#8220;home,&#8221; the chapter draws on
                    Gilles Deleuze and F&#233;lix Guattari&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID25540caf-0abc-41f3-91be-d959ef49b78b" ref-type="bibr" id="IDfa1b8a5d-2407-4400-85de-6fbe6ddb02fa">1987</xref>) concept of the
                    rhizome. Chapter 3 examines the spaces of international schools and their
                    critical roles as important nodes of the expatriate communities in Shanghai. The
                    schools are sites for the continuous everyday routine of expatriate youths, as
                    well as the place for meeting new friends and for engaging in various leisure
                    activities. Chapter 3 also identifies how these schools underpin certain
                    narratives of what it means to be an expatriate and illustrates how they foster
                    the development of collective identities and provide a sense of community for
                    many of the students and their families. Conversations with students also reveal
                    that their perspective of being enrolled at an international school is linked to
                    the interdependent feelings of privilege and pressure.</p>
                <p>Part IV, &#8220;Living,&#8221; zooms in on particular age-specific spatial and
                    social practices and foregrounds the youths&#8217; efforts to create their own
                    spaces. Discussions on age identities in Chapter 1 and ethnographic evidence
                    from nightlife practices in Chapter 2 underline how the construction of
                    collective age identities and related spaces are crucial for teenagers to gain
                    meaning and agency in their migration experience. Chapter 3 provides a specific
                    example of a teenage hangout spot close to the school campus which they refer to
                    as &#8220;the shop&#8221;&#8212;a little street with eateries, a snack shop, and
                    pool tables. This small alley constitutes an &#8220;open space&#8221; (<xref rid="ID5618cbb5-10c6-43bb-9223-5f363214350b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8eef41df-403a-4ed6-8130-6fae48ab29a4">Hassenpflug 2009,

                    interests of the shop-owners, as well as by the youths&#8217; own agency and
                    interests. Here local Chinese shop-owners, customers, and expatriate youths can
                    meet. For the youths, most importantly, the shop provides an everyday space
                    that, unlike the gated communities or the international schools where they spend
                    most of their time, is not characterized by explicit behavioral expectations or
                    rules. Chapter 4 investigates the teenagers&#8217; relations to China and
                    Shanghai&#8217;s local citizens. Based on discussions with the young expatriates
                    on the issue of &#8220;integration,&#8221; the chapter highlights how the youths
                    accept or even strengthen the exclusion of &#8220;China&#8221; from their
                    everyday spaces. It also shows how many of the expatriate youths experience
                    their physical difference as whites, and how this promotes a preference for
                    locations in Shanghai that are mainly occupied or frequented by whites. It then
                    demonstrates how the teenagers&#8217; lack of interaction with Chinese youths
                    and the experience of special (and often preferential) treatment by Chinese
                    citizens lead to their feeling like &#8220;guests&#8221; in China.</p>

                    emotions about leaving&#8212;an amalgamation of sadness, anxiety, and
                    anticipation of what is to come. The last chapter summarizes the various facets

                <p> Geographer Georg Glasze (2006), for instance, brings the particularities of
                    expatriate housing practices to the fore, describing the role of gated
                    communities among expatriates in Saudi Arabia. Katie Walsh (2006a; 2006b; 2008;
                    2011) focuses on British expatriate identities in Dubai, examining cultural
                    practices of domesticity, intimacy, and consequent articulations of belonging
                    and national identity. Heather Hindman (2009a; 2009b) pays detailed attention to
                    the meaning-laden activity of shopping for expatriate women in Nepal and reveals
                    that behind the shopping for art objects and an interest in cuisine lies the
                    need for easily transferable elements in a world of constant movement. Food and
                    art, unlike language skills and local friendships, &#8220;can be utilized as
                    anecdotal parallels in future postings&#8221; (Hindman 2009a, 256). The
                    collected objects at the next destination &#8220;act as means of transferring
                    knowledge and status between locations&#8221; (Hindman 2009b, 676), helping the
                    expatriate women to recreate themselves. Willis and Yeoh (2002; 2005) contribute
                    a comparative angle, writing on British and Singaporean Expatriates in Hong Kong
                    and China based on material from 247 interviews that were conducted between 1997
                    and 2001. They also provide insight into the gendered experiences of privileged
                    migration, a perspective they pursue further in their article on single British
                    migrants in China (Willis and Yeoh 2008).</p>
                <p> James Farrer (2008; 2010; 2011) examines expatriates&#8217; nightlife
                    activities, sexuality, and intermarriage and their relevance to encounters with
                    the &#8220;local&#8221; in Shanghai. In addition to his emphasis on the
                    interaction with &#8220;locals,&#8221; Farrer also broadens the view on
                    expatriates themselves by investigating foreigners in Shanghai who stay longer
                    than five years. Foregrounding their narratives of emplacement, he questions the
                    standard &#8220;equation of expatriates with highly mobile transnational
                    elites&#8221; (2010, 15) and points out the increasing diversity of the

                <p> The Chicago School of Sociology, founded in 1915, laid the groundwork for this
                    field of study in particular with its later monographs in the 1960s and 1970s
                    focusing on specific quarters, districts, and communities within the city
                    (Wildner 1995, 6). Robert Ezra Park, founder of the Chicago School, studied in
                    Berlin under Georg Simmel (Hannerz 1980, 22), whose progressive writings
                    contemplating the living conditions of people in modern cities (Simmel 1903) can
                    be seen as early stepping stones towards an urban anthropology (Wildner 1995,
                    6). Urban anthropology has always been influenced by history, sociology, and
                    geography (Hannerz 1980, 4), in addition to its beginnings in Chicago. Hannerz
                    has argued that the &#8220;remarkable pioneering work in urban ethnography
                    carried out there particularly in the 1920s and 1930s&#8221; has shown that the
                    boundary between sociology and anthropology can largely be disregarded (1980,
                    16). Only by the 1960s did anthropologists, habitually concerned with rural
                    societies, increasingly turn their attention toward cities, faced with
                    urbanization in their &#8220;traditional fields&#8221; as well as changes and
                    so-called &#8220;urban problems&#8221; in their cities at home (ibid., 1).
                    According to Hannerz, it was not until a decade later that the term &#8220;Urban
                    Anthropology&#8221; emerged (ibid., 2). While early ethnographers focusing on
                    cities investigated particular places within the city, later works in urban
                    anthropology saw the necessity of considering the city as a complete whole with
                    a central function in global society (Wildner 1995, 2).</p>
