            <p>This part of the book examines expatriate teenagers&#8217; narratives and practices
                of emplacement in Shanghai. While it continues to address the students as part of
                the expatriate community with its processes of demarcation and detachment from local
                Chinese communities, it zooms in on their particular age-specific spatial and social
                practices. I chose to foreground the youths&#8217; efforts toward creating their own
                spaces, as I understand these to be crucial for teenagers to gain meaning and agency
                in their migration experience. I draw on Howes&#8217; (2007) concept of emplacement
                to further understand how the expatriate youth cultures in Shanghai unfold in
                specific, everyday places and emerge in-between the dynamics of &#8220;uprootings
                and regroundings&#8221; (Ahmed et al. 2003). Howes stresses the importance of
                sensory experiences in everyday life and regards these as &#8220;a field of cultural
                elaboration&#8221; and &#8220;an arena for structuring social roles and
                interactions&#8221; (Howes 2007, xi). For my purposes, I interpret Howes&#8217;
                concept of emplacement as a means of grasping the physical experience of places, of
                being in and engaging with the &#8220;here and now.&#8221; I include in this
                interpretation the idea that how one experiences places simultaneously shapes
                one&#8217;s environment. This approach is in line with Howe&#8217;s argument that
                the process of emplacement is the counterpart to displacement, &#8220;the feeling
                that one is homeless, disconnected from one&#8217;s physical and social
                environment&#8221; (Howes [<xref rid="IDc41cbbe6-a78a-42e2-9d15-b99744a2db62" ref-type="bibr" id="ID222e2ac1-335a-4b19-a535-1d7c3f086402">2005</xref>] 2006,
                7). </p>
            <p>In the chapters that follow, I first discuss students&#8217; conceptions of age
                identities (in Chapter 1) and then move on to their related spatial practices. The
                next two chapters in this part provide two specific examples of youths&#8217; agency
                in creating their own spaces: going out (Chapter 2, on nightlife spaces) and hanging
                out at &#8220;the shop&#8221; (Chapter 3), a space on a small street close to
                school. These two spaces are in stark contrast to the gated communities and the
                schools presented in Part III, which contribute to the youths&#8217; everyday
                experience of Shanghai being divided into &#8220;the city&#8221; and &#8220;expat
                spaces&#8221; (see Part III, Chapter 1). The schools and gated communities are
                characterized by what sociologist Zeiher (<xref rid="ID17def429-a5d6-4673-b525-ef36eac49187" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9e09fff0-836f-46f9-90cc-dabd8dc2639e">2003</xref>) has called
                &#8216;&#8216;insularisation,&#8221; a term which refers to the increasing number of
                places particularly designed for children who move almost entirely between those
                places. While the expatriate teenagers also feel they are mostly being shuttled
                between gated communities and international school compounds, they choose and claim
                the two spaces presented here as their own. The analysis of these two spaces and the
                related construction of age identities also address the students&#8217; overall
                perceptions and representations of the city of Shanghai. Chapter 4 closes this part
                of the book with an examination of the teenagers&#8217; relations to Shanghai and
                its local citizens.</p>

                <p>Migration experiences are evidently age-specific, as the ethnographic vignettes
                    on the decision-making process about moving in Part II, Chapter 1 show. Older
                    siblings, for example, choose to stay, or at least consider staying, whereas
                    younger ones often have no choice. This part therefore discusses the role of age
                    in the migration process by investigating the reflections and the
                    teenagers&#8217; age-related identity performances and ties them to current
                    academic debates on youth that were addressed earlier, in the Introduction.</p>

                    <p> I am sitting outside, in a rather undisturbed corner of the schoolyard, on a
                        few steps behind the track, listening to Karina and Lara&#8217;s accounts of
                        their move to Shanghai about seven months prior. Although it is only the end
                        of February, the sunshine is bright and warm. While the three of us enjoy
                        these first moments of spring, the two girls, like many of my interviewees,
                        explain why they feel it was simply the wrong time for them to move abroad. </p>

                            <p><italic> The younger you are the less painful it is, I think. I
                                    don&#8217;t know. When I was eight years old we moved to [a town
                                    in Northern China]. When my mother told me about it I was really
                                    happy. Right? Every day I asked: &#8220;Has dad signed the
                                    contract yet? Can we finally go to China?&#8221; and so on.
                                    Because, I was younger, and I wanted to experience something.
                                    But the older you get, the stronger your relations to others
                                    become. Somehow. I don&#8217;t know, you get used to them. When
                                    you then get separated from them, I wasn&#8217;t happy any more.
                                    Yippee off to China. Instead, I just screamed at my father.
                                    Because it just sucked.</italic>

                    <p>Both Karina and Lara, seventeen and sixteen years old, believe that age plays
                        a role in the difficulties of moving, arguing that adolescence seems a
                        particularly bad time. Lara explains:</p>
                    <p>

                                It is more difficult. I just experienced that. At my age it just
                                sucks. You have your friends, your boyfriend, whatever.

                    </p>
                    <p>Transnational mobility challenges not only relations to places, but also
                        relationships. As both quotes from the discussion with Karina and Lara show,
                        the two students argue that because relationships to peers grow stronger
                        over the years as one becomes more independent from parents, the move abroad
                        becomes more difficult. Both also point out that school makes it more
                        difficult to move in their mid- or late-teens. They emphazise that moving in
                        the final years before graduation gives them less time to adjust to the new
                        environment, since grades often already count for the final diploma&#8212;a
                        major issue that Britta from Norway also repeatedly stressed during my
                        interview with her at the British school.</p>
                    <p>While most teenagers think of adolescence as the wrong time to move, however,
                        they may also see it as the right time to be in Shanghai. The mega-city
                        offers numerous bars and clubs that commonly do not enforce any age-based
                        entry restrictions. The youths often take this opportunity to explore
                        nightlife to a degree that is usually impossible for their peers in Europe
                        or Northern America. Britta explains: </p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s3">
                            <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                            <p> There is so much nightlife, there is so much fun. &#8216;Cause in
                                Norway you have to be eighteen or twenty-one to get into the club.
                            </p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>The absence of enforced age restrictions in China&#8217;s nightlife spaces
                        makes the stay attractive for teenagers, who are in the process of exploring
                        their age identities. Chapter 2 therefore provides detailed descriptions of
                        these nightlife practices. </p>
                    <p>But regardless of their exciting nightlife options, like Karina, most of my
                        informants perceive and convey adolescence as a difficult time to move.
                        Moreover, they differentiate being a teenager from being a child and argue
                        that the losses experienced by younger children are less severe and that
                        their integration at a new school is easier. The students I interviewed seem
                        to be familiar with&#8212;and even reiterate&#8212;the notion that children
                        are simply part of a family, without any social ties of their own. This goes
                        hand in hand with concepts that see children as not yet fully-developed
                        human beings. Such approaches have lately been criticized and
                        re-conceptualized in anthropology and related disciplines (<xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="ID86789f3b-5676-4cbd-acd9-16ffaf72cf5a">Bucholtz 2002</xref>; <xref rid="IDd7c74262-237b-479f-b7ee-0f40a16b7d44" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc2441fad-b1ef-4d61-a8cf-6af37a321072">Hutchins 2011, see also the

                        studying the experiences of children moving to Australia, stresses how their
                        personal social ties impact the move. I believe that the older teenagers
                        emphasize their distinction from the younger children, as for instance Lara
                        and Karina do when talking about the difficulties of moving, in order to
                        stress the importance of their own social lives and ties and to counteract
                        being perceived as having none. </p>
                    <p>The two seemingly contradicting discourses presented here&#8212;that of
                        adolescence being the wrong time for moving, but the right time for living
                        in Shanghai&#8212;actually support each other. Both narratives serve to
                        perform and manifest the specific age identities of someone who is gradually
                        outgrowing the realm of the family.</p>

                    <p>As shown in earlier parts of the book, experiences abroad are often
                        considered to be beneficial capital for the future: the hardship of moving
                        at an early age will pay off when the children grow up and enter
                        professional life. This focus on development for future benefit is common
                        when discussing young people&#8217;s lives and underlies the idea of
                        adolescence. Mary Bucholtz (<xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe23f8c31-b6e2-4678-8def-c8b4b7fab9d4">2002</xref>) has argued that
                        anthropological and sociological works on adolescence often see this
                        development as a staging ground for integration into the adult community.
                        Conceptualizations of this kind frame young people&#8217;s own cultural
                        practices solely in relation to adult concerns. Bucholtz has consequently
                        called for a shift, not only terminologically but also theoretically, from
                        the anthropology of adolescence to the anthropology of youth. She aims at
                        research practices that focus on youth&#8217;s own perspectives and that
                        distance themselves from the conceptualization of adolescence as merely a
                        phase dedicated to leading towards adulthood: &#8220;Where the study of
                        adolescence generally concentrates on how bodies and minds are shaped for
                        adult futures, the study of youth emphasizes instead the here-and-now of
                        young people&#8217;s experience, the social and cultural practices through
                        which they shape their worlds&#8221; (Bucholtz <xref rid="ID6263e76c-5280-489e-baaf-1eeedf514565" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8919c20f-eab3-4f3f-84eb-415d2988ce51">2002</xref>, 532).</p>
                    <p>Bucholtz&#8217;s argument is echoed by Allison and Adrian James, who find
                        that society&#8217;s (and often research&#8217;s) focus on children&#8217;s

                        his own future-driven social status as a teenager.</p>
                    <p>While I, in the future-oriented status of a PhD candidate (routinely facing
                        questions such as &#8220;What do you want to do afterwards?&#8221;), might
                        have been particularly sensitive to the pressures of planning and working
                        hard for the future, the expatriate youths seldom verbalized this pressure
                        directly. Reading between the lines, however, their worries over what to
                        study or which career to pursue hinted at the future-orientedness that
                        underlies expatriate youth&#8217;s experiences in Shanghai. While pondering
                        the loaded question of what lies ahead (for my subjects and myself), I came
                        across an art project by the German student Andrea entitled &#8220;My time
                        is now.&#8221; (Figure 21).</p>

                    <p>The art project consists of several photographs showing children and
                        teenagers holding up or standing in front of a sign that displays, line
                        after line, the text &#8220;My time is now,&#8221; as well as students
                        wearing a white t-shirt with the same text. In many cases, a group of
                        students or individuals look into the camera, laughing or enjoying
                        themselves. To secure the anonymity of students, however, I only include
                        images from Andrea&#8217;s project that do not reveal faces (Figure

                        last fieldwork stay in June 2012, after having contemplated these images for
                        several months back in Germany, that I arranged an interview with Andrea to
                        discuss her art project. During our interview, we sit in a sidewalk cafe,
                        the voice-recorder between us. I ask her to explain the project and its
                        context of production.</p>

                            They always like to draw attention to their community and so on, their
                            school life&#8212;practically like a publicity campaign. That&#8217;s
                            extremely embarrassing, sometimes. Then I thought this would be
                            appreciated at our school. And it was, by teachers and so on. So I
                            proceeded like this: okay, now I do a project, [and] because I am not a
                            good photographer, [it] doesn&#8217;t need to be photographically
                            convincing. But it can allude a little bit to us being one school,
                            &#8220;sheltered and grown together&#8221; [referring to the school
                            slogan] and so on. Because it&#8217;s not really German to represent
                            yourself like that, I thought my teachers might pick up on that. And erm

&lt;L&gt;, everything was really pretty cheesy. And then I used Google
                            to see what kind of quotes exist, because I wanted to do something with
                            text and photography. Well and then &#8220;My time is now&#8221;
                            appeared, which is really perfect. And a bit too kitschy. And then I
                            made this t-shirt. I thought, &#8220;Okay, then they can wear that or
                            hold it.&#8221;                                [&#8230;] And this sign. And then I walked around school
                            and asked a few students to help me. And then I asked my friends if they
                            would help me, because I don&#8217;t like being like: &#8220;Hello, my
                                name is Andrea! We are &lt;x&gt;.&#8221; Of course I put some effort
                            into involving some French students, because it refers even more to this
                            social inclusion that is so popular at every school in Germany.</italic>

                    <p>While I had interpreted the art project as a statement against the pressure
                        to focus on the future and as an appeal to look at the moment in Shanghai,
                        my interview with Andrea pointed in a different direction. Her approach to
                        the project had been more that of a designer working at a marketing agency,
                        with customers&#8212;the teachers and the school&#8212;clearly in mind when
                        choosing the theme and producing the images. However, the success of her
                        images within the school also shows in what fertile ground Andrea had
                        planted her idea: her claim, &#8220;My time is now,&#8221; was used for the
                        whole school&#8217;s art project that would later win a state-sponsored
                        award for the school&#8217;s arts program (see Part III, Chapter 3, where I
                        comment on the movie that her schoolmate Kressi shot for the awards
                        ceremony). Andrea&#8217;s photography project rendered the
                        future-orientedness in the students&#8217; lives visible to educators and
                        the school community.</p>

                    <p>While the expatriate students like to emphasize their own social
                        ties&#8212;for instance when talking about the experience of moving to
                        Shanghai, as Karina&#8217;s and Lara&#8217;s narratives in the beginning of
                        this chapter demonstrate&#8212;one should not be tempted to read their
                        acknowledgement of these ties as evidence of their wanting to be
                        &#8220;adults.&#8221; Their practices of distinguishing themselves from
                        younger children are not aimed at their being seen as &#8220;adults,&#8221;
                        but rather as &#8220;youths.&#8221; This becomes clear in their disapproval

                        occupy or interfere with spaces that they have claimed as their own. I argue
                        that they make this claim to distinguish themselves from adults and

                    <title>2.1. Shanghai&#8217;s nightlife spaces</title>
                    <p>This chapter shows how Shanghai&#8217;s nightscapes are a crucial platform
                        for the identity negotiations of expatriate youths. While not all students
                        participate in nightlife activities,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e422">9</xref> clubbing practices are nevertheless pivotal because they are
                        central to teenagers&#8217; involvement with the city; they are also an
                        important form of coming to terms with the move to Shanghai. Here, teenagers
                        claim new spaces collectively, and without the inclusion of their families.
                        In exploring these practices, this chapter first analyzes Shanghai&#8217;s
                        nightlife spaces in general to examine the conditions it presents to the
                        teenage patrons. Considering that, in Shanghai, there are&#8212;de
                        facto&#8212;no age-based restrictions to clubs or bars, I first examine the
                        resulting heated debates on teenage nightlife practices in the expatriate
                        community, as well as students&#8217; accounts of negotiating parental
                        concern in the second section. The next section gives a detailed description
                        of teenagers&#8217; habits when they go out, based on participant
                        observations as well as interviews. Based on the Friday night routine at a
                        club called Mural, it analyzes how going out is a break from the school
                        routine, a means to play with and affirm their age, gender, cosmopolitan,
                        and urban identities, and a way to stregthen friendships. The fourth and
                        final section concludes the analysis of the role of nightlife spaces in
                        teenage expatriates&#8217; experiences of their stay in Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>When entering bars or clubs in Shanghai, I often feel like many of them could
                        be in any large city or tourist location. The menu displays the same
                        cocktails, wines, and liquors that are offered elsewhere. Occasionally,
                        local beers, mostly <italic>Qingdao</italic>, are presented along with
                        international beer brands. The music played, although varying between
                        locations in Shanghai, is typical of mainstream party locations in Europe.
                        People&#8217;s attire depends on the locations&#8217; dress codes, which are
                        implicitly or openly stated: the men often wear dress shirts and the women
                        display more skin and make-up than during the day. Everyone seems to be
                        engaged in practices familiar from nightlife locations in Europe: chatting,
                        drinking, and sometimes dancing. One finds the same tastes, same sounds,
                        same visuals, and same practices. Thus, Shanghai offers a very international
                        dance club scene.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e433">10</xref> My own
                        immediate familiarity with all these sensory impressions and patterns

                        conceptualization of Shanghai&#8217;s bars and clubs as belonging to a

                        concept refers primarily to &#8220;the ways in which these local urban
                        nightscapes are sites of transnational flows.&#8221; Additionally, these

                        findings&#8212;are &#8220;constructed through globalising cultural and
                        corporate processes that homogenise and stratify nightlife

                        globalisation means that anyone familiar with nightlife in other global

                        relative ease upon landing in the city, using the categories of spaces
                        learned already in similar settings&#8221; (<xref rid="IDaa1cf9f0-6452-4e2d-af50-825da053aac2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa77f8133-1d68-4db0-852d-323e590d2cb7">Farrer 2011, 748</xref>). </p>
                    <p>There are locations in Shanghai, such as Karaoke bars, clubs with big seating
                        areas and small dance floors, beverages which must be ordered by the bottle,
                        and those where people play Chinese drinking games based on dice rolling,
                        which offer unfamiliar experiences to the foreign visitor. The expatriate
                        youths, however, mostly choose clubs that are very international in terms of
                        sounds, drinks, and practices. If they go to clubs that they label as
                        &#8220;more Chinese,&#8221; they still pursue their familiar ways of
                        partying. In general, Shanghai offers many locations that follow such a
                        pattern of nightlife aimed toward a global audience; these locations are
                        easy for me and the students alike to navigate.</p>
                    <p>Nightlife in Shanghai, however, is only easy to navigate to those who can
                        afford it: the drinks cost as much as a meal for two in a local restaurant,
                        the cover charges are high, and taxi rides are necessary because the subway
                        and most buses stop running at eleven p.m. Consequently, the majority of
                        clubs are only affordable to the upper-middle classes of Shanghai.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e450">11</xref> Despite&#8212;or maybe even
                        because of&#8212;this stratification, I argue that, given the spaces&#8217;
                        orientation toward profit, all the clubs and bars we visited fit into Paul

                        &#8220;mainstream.&#8221; In their book Urban Nightscapes, Chatterton and
                        Hollands argue that city nightlife today is characterized by
                        &#8220;mainstream production, through the corporatisation of ownership via
                        processes of branding and theming&#8221; as well as &#8220;regulation,
                        through practices which increasingly aid capital accumulation and urban
                        image-building.&#8221; These practices simultaneously heighten surveillance
                        and &#8220;consumption, through new forms of segmented nightlife activity
                        driven by processes of gentrification and the adoption of 'upmarket'
                        lifestyle identities among groups of young adults&#8221; (<xref rid="IDd6225296-7924-449f-8be5-df0780db3d88" ref-type="bibr" id="ID60476678-4048-42ed-a1dd-2b39bce2e46c">Chatterton and Hollands
                            2003, 7</xref>). Chatterton and Hollands&#8217;s analysis is concerned
                        with nightlife spaces in Great Britain; however, the processes of theming,
                        urban-image building, surveillance, and gentrification are also prominent in
                        Shanghai, and not only in its nightlife spaces. In preparation for the World
                        Expo in 2010, the city underwent a degree of polishing, which also
                        stimulated gentrification projects in areas such as the former French
                        concession.</p>
                    <p>As competitive and future-oriented as Shanghai presented itself to be in
                        hosting the expo, it simultaneously shines brightly with nostalgia,
                        particularly at night. High-end restaurants, bars, and clubs in Shanghai are
                        often located either in old buildings of the former French concession, or in
                        those along Shanghai&#8217;s waterfront, the Bund. Thus, the physical
                        locations of nightlife spaces build upon the city&#8217;s colonial past.
                        Some places are even restored to their former glory, i.e. the premises of
                        the former Shanghai Club located at the Bund, the principal men&#8217;s club
                        for British residents of colonial Shanghai during its heyday in the 1920s
                        and 1930s, famous for its thirty-four-meter-long bar. The Waldorf Astoria
                        that now runs the building rebuilt the &#8220;long bar&#8221; after
                        photographs from 1911 and re-opened it in October <xref rid="ID985b5dc7-cc6c-4601-a7b7-29bd40a82cc4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID0b3acd63-b136-44ce-a733-0be22ac15c22">2010</xref> (<xref rid="ID985b5dc7-cc6c-4601-a7b7-29bd40a82cc4" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6788cc9b-eb25-4332-92b5-6a528e19c07b">McDermott 2010</xref>).

                        For teenagers in the contemporary North, for instance, the law usually
                        prohibits their consumption of alcohol and consequently restricts their
                        participation in nightlife spaces. Accepting Valentine&#8217;s (<xref rid="IDb5995c57-1baa-48d2-910a-b60799d34655" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9ca263e4-fb54-4eca-b153-5f10b7b0c62b">2003</xref>) observations
                        that a lack of personal funds and independent transportation, as well as
                        laws and policies, restricts many youths&#8217; access to nightlife spaces,
                        I will now consider more closely how these aspects come into play in
                        Shanghai. </p>
                    <p>Students in Shanghai stress that restrictions are comparably fewer in China
                        than they are elsewhere. Lacking funds is less of a problem, too. Many
                        common items and services that would cost the same or more in Germany are
                        affordable for the students in Shanghai, given their parents&#8217;
                        income&#8212;and despite those items being relatively expensive by the local
                        economy&#8217;s standards. As I described in Part II, Chapter 1
                        &#8220;Making sense of the city,&#8221; access to transportation is also
                        comparably easy. Returning home late in Shanghai&#8212;even after the
                        subways system closes at eleven p.m.&#8212;proves easy, because taxis are
                        readily available and affordable for expat youth. Not only transportation,
                        but also safety, according to the two students Peter and Marco, is less of a
                        concern here than in Germany.</p>

                                buses leave at twelve. And because taxis are relatively expensive in
                                Germany, everyone all of a sudden leaves at twelve. Well, and here
                                some leave at one, others at four. Also because of the safety, you

                        can afford the entrance fees. Teenagers are allowed to enter these bars and
                        clubs and even gain unlimited access to alcohol at their so-called

                        imposed by their parents. Most parents do not allow their children to
                        participate in all activities and, for my research subjects, participation
                        in nightlife is a subject of ongoing negotiation with their parents. The

                    <p>While some students come up with strategies to overcome parental authority
                        with the help of friends, a few students simply rebel and act against their
                        parents&#8217; guidelines. Seventeen-year-old Paul, for instance,
                        shares:</p>

                            <p> Well, my parents didn&#8217;t know. We snuck out. And eventually

                    </p>
                    <p>In the same interview, however, Paul also admits that, for this behavior, he
                        was grounded for a whole school year from any nightlife activity. These
                        stories seem to be the parental nightmares that circulate among the
                        expatriate community and fuel images of unruly teens. </p>
                    <p>Nightlife and alcohol consumption among teenagers are seen as a severe
                        problem in the parental expatriate community in Shanghai. While a full
                        discourse analysis is beyond the scope of this ethnography, I gained an
                        overview based on local expatriate magazines, discussions with the community
                        organization Shanghai Lifeline, an interview with a school counselor, and
                        observations at talks targeted at expatriate parents. The discussions on
                        teenage nightlife practices in Shanghai can be seen as oscillating between
                        debates on health concerns on the one hand and what might be considered
                        moral panic on the other. </p>
                    <p>The easy access to clubs and bars, health concerns, and fear of possible
                        alcohol addiction, for instance, are discussed in detail in the article
                        &#8220;Teenage Drinking&#8221; in the Summer 2007 issue of <italic>City
                            Weekend: Shanghai Parents and Kids</italic>. The article teaser warns:

                        alcohol abuse on the rise amongst teenagers in Shanghai, a 16-year-old teen

                        articles and talks given to the community are targeted at parents. I was not
                        surprised to see the announcement for an event entitled &#8220;Sex, Drugs,
                        and Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll&#8221; at an international school in Pudong in
                        the fall of 2010. The evening event, well-attended by parents, hosted a
                        social worker and a speaker from the British Consulate. They gave insights
                        into how to talk with teens about alcohol and drugs, and about the legal
                        consequences of drug abuse in China. Parents were particularly concerned
                        about clarifying rumors that an entire family could be deported from Chinese
                        territory if one of their children was caught in possession of drugs. </p>
                    <p>Measures aiming to counteract alcohol abuse among teenagers have also been
                        taken. In 2010, a telephone help-line service targeted at expatriates called
                        Shanghai Lifeline, was in the midst of establishing workshops for youths to
                        inform, counteract, and/or prevent alcohol or drug abuse. Likewise, the
                        Community Center Shanghai established a program called Interkom in 2007,
                        which was advertised as a program that &#8220;provides a positive
                        alternative to the rise of drug and alcohol abuse and accessibility to high
                        risk activities to international teens in Shanghai&#8221; (<italic><xref rid="IDd8b12edd-d64d-4589-b037-55af4fad520b" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc729ac0e-ffbd-4805-8122-10d4399212ad">Community Center

                        the Shanghai Lifeline project, also managed to influence certain restaurants
                        in the Jinqiao expatriate residential areas to refrain from providing
                        alcohol to minors by threatening to blacklist these locations&#8212;mostly
                        western-style family restaurants&#8212;within the expatriate community. Some
                        of the international schools have reacted to the open bars and the heated
                        debate among Shanghai&#8217;s expatria by introducing regular drug testing. </p>
                    <p>While these discussions very likely take place in other countries and
                        environments as well, these negotiations seem particularly present for
                        expatriate families in Shanghai because parents are the only de facto
                        regulating authorities. An article entitled &#8220;Shanghai&#8217;s
                        Tormented Teens,&#8221; Global Times China, an online newspaper, reviewed a
                        talk by a Shanghai-based doctor, Tim Kelly, on understanding teenagers.
                        Kelly noted that &#8220;often families find that whatever were vulnerable
                        points before coming to Shanghai, like arguments about curfews and homework,
                        become exacerbated here&#8221; (<xref rid="ID6be6da29-35f2-4efc-8ff0-6c52d706c3f6" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa0ec88fe-b26c-4f7b-9645-9784572cf249">Peterson 2011</xref>). </p>
                    <p>From the teenagers&#8217; perspectives, however, nightlife is an ideal way to
                        forge ties with their peers. I observed that students who are not allowed
                        (or willing) to accompany their peers to nightlife activities are pitied by
                        their classmates and sometimes have difficulty positioning themselves within
                        their class or certain peer groups. It is also noteworthy that, in this
                        context, my relationships with the teenagers whom I regularly joined for
                        nightlife activities became closer than those of the other students I
                        interviewed and resulted in further invitations to participate in
                        activities.</p>

                    <p>The last two subchapters described Shanghai&#8217;s nightscapes as global,
                        mainstream, and having links to Shanghai&#8217;s past, as well as the
                        absence of age-based restrictions to clubs and alcohol and the resulting
                        negotiations between parents and teenagers. In this section, I highlight one
                        specific place that is popular among the groups from the German school: a
                        club called Mural. The club was by far the one students frequented most,
                        which is why a detailed description and analysis of how the teenagers&#8217;
                        nightlife practices and the meanings embedded in them were acted out in this
                        specific location offer important insights. I discuss seven aspects that are
                        relevant for understanding the teenagers&#8217; typical nights out at Mural:
                        1. The social aesthetics of the club, 2. Friday night as a marker between
                        school routines and the weekend, 3. How the club and its open bar allow
                        teenagers to play with age identities, 4. The gendered ways of going out, 5.
                        Nightlife practices as a group activity, 6. Nightlife spaces as stages for
                        cosmopolitan performances, and 7. Going out as an urban experience.</p>

                            as a &#8220;shared aesthetic space&#8221; among the teenagers. Drawing
                            again on MacDougall&#8217;s concept of &#8220;social aesthetics,&#8221;
                            which describes &#8220;the creation of an aesthetic space or sensory

                            practices that shape the experience of a night at Mural. MacDougall does
                            not understand &#8220;aesthetics&#8221; in the traditional sense, that
                            is as notions about beauty or art, but as a &#8220;wider range of
                            culturally patterned sensory experience&#8221; (<xref rid="IDef1f2770-65ae-4ab1-8e85-6a994aa77bc5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID38aad986-867c-4052-a2d7-b4c832bc199b">ibid., 98</xref>). He
                            sees the social aesthetic field as the coalescence of different
                            elements, such as objects and actions, and finds it a &#8220;physical
                            manifestation of the largely internalized and invisible &#8216;embodied
                            history&#8217; that Bourdieu calls habitus&#8221; (<xref rid="IDef1f2770-65ae-4ab1-8e85-6a994aa77bc5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID92e75ae6-e8bd-4b97-806c-60c6abe75360">2006, 98</xref>). While
                            MacDougall applies his concept to a boarding school in India, I believe
                            certain social aesthetics of a nightclub can be experienced similarly.
                            Ben Malbon (<xref rid="IDae53a4a5-51e9-48d3-b912-6460b385c6ce" ref-type="bibr" id="ID80ec214a-86f7-44c2-a422-bb1ef75bef46">1998</xref>), similarly to but independent from MacDougall&#8217;s
                            social aesthetics, describes how a shared space is created in nightclubs
                            not only through sensory experiences (lighting, music, physical

                            thinks that clubbers actively shape their experience: &#8220;the club
                            situation offers clubbers opportunities to inscribe their own
                            creativities upon a shared space to create a space of their own making
                            of which they are also the consumers.&#8221; What kind of social
                            aesthetic, with its patterns and emotional effects, does a Friday night
                            at Mural hold for expatriate youths?</p>
                        <p>Mural lies in the heart of the city, just off Hengshan Road, a popular
                            bar and boutique street that was already central during the time of the
                            former French concession, and underwent large-scale renovation in the
                            first two decades of the twenty-first century. The bar is conveniently
                            located near a subway station and is close to restaurants and some local
                            shops. In the evenings, street vendors selling cigarettes greet you
                            outside as you enter the building and proceed down the stairs to the
                            basement. The club itself is spacious, features a long bar, a section
                            with tables and chairs, another area with couches and low tables, and an
                            elevated dance floor. There are no windows and the lighting is
                            unobtrusive, with tea lights on the tables adding to the atmosphere.
                            Mural&#8217;s owners present the bar on their website using images of
                            the location sitting empty, with tastefully-arranged furniture and
                            enveloped in a warm light. The accompanying text informs the online

                        </p>
                        <p>My personal impression of the club was quite different. While the
                            cave-like atmosphere is strongly supported by its basement location, the
                            theme &#8220;5000 years of history&#8221; is easily forgotten when the
                            place is packed to its limits on a Friday night. Interestingly, the
                            &#8220;mix of Chinese tradition and western new age&#8221; is attempted
                            not only through decorations such as wooden tablets adorned with old
                            Chinese text, but also through Sanskrit words and depictions of sutras
                            on the stone walls. These decorations, however, seem to regularly
                            disappear behind clubgoers. Students could not recall these wall
                            decorations in detail when I asked about them, despite regularly
                            spending their Friday nights in the club. The social aesthetics of the
                            bar are also tied to specific events and their themes. Mural hosts a
                            ladies&#8217; night on Wednesdays and a salsa night every Monday. It is
                            only on Fridays, however, that the two groups of friends, &#8220;the
                            girls&#8221; and &#8220;the boys&#8221; (see Part I, Chapter 3), choose
                            Mural as their standard location (Figure 22).</p>
                        <p>Every Friday night, Mural hosts an open bar. Its website announces this
                            weekly event as &#8220;Up Your Funk,&#8221; and underlines this with the
                            call &#8220;Free ya mind&#160;&#8230; and ya ass will follow.&#8221;
                            This, the website assures its visitors, will be achieved by the
                            &#8220;hottest DJs&#8221; and the open bar. The music usually consists
                            of a mix between soul, funk, disco, and other genres, going through
                            different phases as the evening progresses. A dress code is not enforced
                            and jeans, sneakers, or t-shirts hinder no one from entering. Guests are
                            mainly in their twenties. I estimate the ratio of Chinese and foreign
                            patrons attending the club on Friday nights at roughly 1:2. The
                            proportion of female to male clubgoers is comparable. The open bar means
                            that the cover charge of RMB 100 (&#8364;11) covers all drinks, from
                            soft drinks and beer, to cocktails and liquor. At the bar, you are
                            served the first three kinds of drinks, while guests are given two
                            different kinds of shots at a special table set up next to the entrance
                            and the cloakroom. &#8220;The boys&#8221; always book a table with three
                            couches in advance. This couch section serves as home base during the
                            evening for both &#8220;the girls&#8221; and &#8220;the boys.&#8221;
                            Students come and go, moving back and forth between the bar, dance
                            floor, and the stairs just outside the club. The open bar ends at two
                            a.m., usually leading to many guests going home or moving on to the next
                            location. </p>
                        <p>For the students, the most important parts of the club are arguably the
                            people, music, the couches, and the special setting of the open bar on
                            Friday nights. As their favorite club, Mural produces, through its
                            location, decor, drinks, and guests&#8217; practices of dressing and
                            socializing, a specific landscape that the students perceive as
                            particularly &#8220;relaxed.&#8221;</p>

                            organization of daily and weekly life for a large segment of the

                            the practices of going out, dancing, and consuming alcohol as markers
                            between the school-week and the weekend for these teenagers, who often
                            conceptualize nightlife in the same way: </p>

                                <p> I party every Friday. That is a privilege. It is a must after
                                    the week. I couldn&#8217;t do without it. That would be too
                                    boring.  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e831">17</xref></p>
                            </speech>
                        </p>
                        <p>Linked to this understanding of Friday night routines as rituals to mark
                            the transition from the tightly-structured school-week to the weekend,
                            teenagers also put forth the idea of partying as a reward for working
                            hard in school.</p>
                        <p>The Friday night routine usually starts with a shared taxi ride to the
                            downtown area&#8212;I never witnessed anyone taking the metro to go out.
                            Sometimes, students also dine out together before clubbing. For
                            &#8220;the girls,&#8221; the night often begins with communal dressing
                            up. The appropriate party outfit is an important ingredient of the
                            nightlife experience and supports the break between week and weekend.
                            When I join the group for the first time on a night out in January 2011,
                            meeting them at Mural after having texted Antonia who invited me, I feel
                            a little bit out of place and have trouble determining which topics and
                            practices are appropriate. My early field notes from this night out
                            later remind me of these beginnings: &#8220;The girls were also dressed
                            accordingly: high heels, tight leggings, short skirts or leopard-print
                            dresses&#160;&#8230; I felt a bit clumsy in my jeans and sneakers next
                            to those sixteen-year-old beauties, all dressed up for their night
                            out&#8221; (fieldnotes, January 2011).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e846">18</xref>
                            <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e849">19</xref>
                        </p>
                        <p>I naively thought that jeans and sneakers would be appropriate for a
                            rather casual place like Mural. But while the club does not demand a
                            certain dress code, the girls enjoy the ritual of dressing up. They even
                            document this ritual on Facebook by posting photos of themselves with
                            eyelash curlers, before their bathroom mirrors. Through different
                            clothes and drinks, the weekend is thus conjured up and the school
                            world, which poses particular social relationships for the teens, is
                            transformed into the entirely different sphere of weekend nightlife.</p>

                        <title>Acting mature: from teen to club guest</title>
                        <p>During their Friday nights at Mural, some students like to stay on the
                            couches, drinking, smoking, chatting, and listening to music, while
                            others enjoy themselves on Mural&#8217;s elevated dance floor. The
                            students get up in turns to stand in line at the bar to fetch beers or
                            long drinks, or, occasionally, to get a round of shots at the small bar
                            for the group. Similar to how Gusfield (<xref rid="IDd43032c4-b21c-45a0-bd83-5d7d26bf3b14" ref-type="bibr" id="ID7af3583e-7f47-447e-aeea-0eb816fb7911">1987, 81</xref>)
                            describes that, by buying rounds, &#8220;each person takes
                            responsibility for payment of the drink of all members of the group, no
                            matter what his own consumption will be or has been,&#8221; the open bar
                            allows the teenagers to provide their friends with drinks and to show
                            they care for their group without having to ask their friends for money
                            or put a strain on their allowance (Figure 23). </p>
                        <p>Thus the attractiveness of the open bar does not necessarily lie in the
                            possibility of binge drinking or getting drunk cheaply, but rather in
                            the way it allows the teenagers to foster ties with their friends. When
                            they bring each other drinks, teenagers strengthen the overall
                            interaction within the group and feel that they have provided for each
                            other. Without having to worry about spending too much, each person can
                            get something for everyone, and feel he or she has contributed equally. </p>
                        <p>By enabling teenagers to &#8220;buy&#8221; drinks for others, the open
                            bar at Mural also provides the youths with a space to practice
                            &#8220;typical&#8221; adult patron behaviors that they might associate
                            with nightlife spaces. This testing and practicing of
                            &#8220;appropriate&#8221; ways to behave in bars and clubs is similar to
                            sociologist Yuki Kato&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID9b6999f2-adb6-45f2-bc8e-260b50645006" ref-type="bibr" id="ID02996283-8888-4e5f-ad03-817599b67257">2009</xref>)

                            demonstrates how youths actively negotiate the behavioral norms

                            Based on the observations of these spatial and social practices, Kato

                        <p>The relationship between identity performances and spaces becomes visible
                            in this interview passage where being young in a space for older people
                            is interpreted as &#8220;cool,&#8221; whereas if everyone is younger
                            than you, your &#8220;standard for being cool&#8221; changes. While he

                            young age, he now finds these young kids &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; and as
                            lacking &#8220;self-control.&#8221; Coolness is related to
                            transgressions of age-based space restrictions. Therefore we can
                            understand expatriate teenagers&#8217; nightlife practices as ways of
                            establishing and transforming age-identities; the nightclub provides the
                            space for such transformations. However, we can also see the performance
                            and affirmation of gender and group identities in these practices of

                            drinks</title>
                        <p>While &#8220;the girls&#8221; manifest their participation in nightlife
                            and hence their coolness through dressing up and dancing, &#8220;the
                            boys&#8221; often display their involvement in cool nightlife practices
                            by drinking and smoking cigarettes or marijuana. The girls meet before
                            going to the club, to get ready together by putting on make-up and
                            changing clothes. The boys, on the other hand, get ready by consuming
                            alcohol. Both practices are regularly documented by taking pictures and
                            can be seen as integral parts of the night out. These gendered practices
                            can also explain, at least partly, the two groups&#8217; different
                            preferences of locations: the girls particularly enjoy going to upscale
                            clubs (where a dress code requires more extravagant attire) while the
                            boys prefer places like Mural (where the drinks are affordable). These
                            differences in practices often reinforce the gender divide that plays a

                                        people watch, who don&#8217;t know that you do those things
                                        regularly, and it makes its rounds at school, because we are
                                        such a small community.  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1004">21</xref></p>

                        <p>Bjorn is concerned with the issue of mutual surveillance, which he
                            attributes to &#8220;the girls.&#8221; He feels he and his male peers
                            can &#8220;let themselves go,&#8221; behave against expectations, if no
                            one observes&#8212;or later judges&#8212;them. While at first sight the
                            teenagers eagerly and flawlessly adapt to the common (adult) practices
                            in the club, their ways of forming their own nightlife routines and,
                            sometimes, ways of avoiding the expected &#8220;mature&#8221;
                            performance become visible after a closer look. The students, for
                            instance, like to go outside and sit on the stairs in front of the club.
                            The security team at the entrance never makes any objections when beer
                            is brought outside. Here, students engage in conversation more easily
                            and get some fresh air. &#8220;The boys&#8221; often seek the privacy of
                            a nearby back alley to smoke pot. This is perceived as a boys&#8217;
                            zone and &#8220;the girls&#8221; do not follow. I only witnessed
                            marijuana consumption among &#8220;the boys,&#8221; which &#8220;the
                            girls,&#8221; at the beginning of my fieldwork, found rather annoying.
                            During my last stay in June 2012, however, &#8220;the girls&#8221;
                            objected less and some of them had meanwhile tried smoking marijuana on
                            one or two occasions. However, consuming drugs is a highly gendered
                            activity. While both &#8220;the girls&#8221; and &#8220;the boys&#8221;
                            drink alcohol, none of &#8220;the girls&#8221; smoke cigarettes.
                            &#8220;The boys&#8221; usually purchase their drugs by contacting a
                            dealer via text message to then meet them at a nearby McDonalds.
                            Occasionally, &#8220;the boys&#8221; spontaneously buy marijuana at some
                            of the street barbecue stalls that are set up after dusk in the lively
                            areas of Shanghai.</p>

                        <title>Teaming up: nightlife as a peer group activity</title>
                        <p>&#8220;I flee to the teenage group; they are my protective herd
                            now,&#8221; I hastily write in my field diary sometime in the morning
                            hours after a night out at Mural. I describe my own reaction to a man
                            approaching me too closely on the dance floor. Feeling uncomfortable, I
                            simply leave the elevated dance floor, pass the crowded bar area, and
                            retreat to the teenagers who are sitting in their usual couch section.
                            It is one of those moments that are commonly described in ethnographic
                            writing as &#8220;eye-opening.&#8221; Although now almost a clich&#233;d
                            and overly stylized aspect of the genre, such moments nevertheless
                            demonstrate how the ethnographer feels when achieving a new level of
                            insight. To me, this moment of dropping down on the couch next to the
                            teenage students is reminiscent of such accounts: all of a sudden, I
                            experience the peer group in a new way, as something protective. </p>
                        <p>Interested in the importance of the group for these teenagers&#8217;
                            nightlife practices, I discuss the issue with Bjorn during our interview
                            in June 2012. He shares that if one of his close friends and group
                            members cannot afford to go out, the group will usually renegotiate
                            their plans and meet at one of the boys&#8217; homes, instead. Nightlife
                            activities can thus be seen as finding and displaying alliances and
                            friendships and as crucial for friendship and peer group development. As
                            noted earlier, those who do not partake regularly are in a more
                            difficult position at school and find it harder to become part of a
                            group. The peer group also forms a basis for interaction in class during
                            the week.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1024">22</xref> Establishing and
                            belonging to a social circle of friends is a process for youths all over
                            the world. However, in an environment of constant coming and going, the
                            task of finding friends who can communally experience the stay in
                            Shanghai can be difficult. Bjorn recalls the beginning of his time in
                            Shanghai almost two years earlier:</p>
                        <p>
                            <speech id="s53">

                                <p>It was difficult to find out which friends suited me best. In the
                                    beginning, I was hanging out with entirely different people
                                    because they had taken me in first. And the friends whom I have
                                    now, the ones I&#8217;ve spent the last one and a half years
                                    with, weren&#8217;t even interested in the beginning. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1044">23</xref></p>
                            </speech>
                        </p>
                        <p>Bjorn&#8217;s comment shows how the teenage students constantly negotiate
                            their relations, trying to find friends that &#8220;suit them
                            best.&#8221; Nightlife plays a crucial role in this process. </p>
                        <p>The two peer groups I worked with, in addition to mutual interests and
                            being in the same classes at school, are mainly based on gender. These
                            gender divides are, on the one hand, strengthened by peer group
                            nightlife routines. On the other hand, nightlife offers opportunities
                            for the two groups and their classmates to casually interact. Sexual
                            interests can be articulated towards members of the other group while
                            the safety net of one&#8217;s own peer group remains intact.
                            Students&#8217; first romantic and sexual encounters
                            emerge&#8212;although not solely&#8212;in these circles, as the
                            connection between the peer groups and their acquaintances offer a basis
                            for familiarity and trust. It is likely for this reason that several
                            couples formed within the two peer groups and their extended network
                            over the two years that I worked with them. </p>

                        <p>Approaching girls or boys outside the network is seen as positive, but I
                            rarely witnessed such interactions. Paul explains this pattern in an
                            interview:</p>

                                <p> I guess, it&#8217;s cool to date a chick at your school. But
                                    people around my school, they go for girls who are at different
                                    schools. Like, there is a social stigma behind dating girls of
                                    your own school.</p>

                            quality. However, it seemed to hint at the dynamics in the expatriate
                            community that I have come across during interviews with white
                            expatriate women in Shanghai in 2007&#8212;processes of
                            &#8220;othering&#8221; Chinese women as exotic, erotic, or
                            white-men-hunters. These expatriate women, mostly so-called
                            &#8220;trailing spouses,&#8221; whom I interviewed during my first
                            fieldwork among Shanghai&#8217;s expatriate community, perceived Chinese
                            women and their possible encounters with expatriate men (their husbands)
                            as threatening their marriage and lifestyle. Looking into these dynamics

                                    and theatres, a prominent component of city night-life, and
                                    club-goers themselves do not tend to treat nightclubs as
                                    significations of an urban setting as much as intrinsic elements
                                    of that setting. Hence, nightclubs have become something of what

                                    excitement of youth and popular culture merges indistinguishably
                                    with the freedom and excitement of life in the big city (<xref rid="ID61dbb008-1c7a-4e73-875c-4d073dbb62bb" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc73cfbfb-f8ad-4506-bafe-a56218a5545b">Northcote 2006,

                        <p>Likewise, students regularly reduce their relationship with Shanghai to
                            nightlife activities. Nightlife therefore plays a key role in the
                            migration process of expat youths by enabling them to identify Shanghai
                            as &#8220;their&#8221; city.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, Paul&#8217;s statement (&#8220;Shanghai is a bit of a

                            indirectly contrasts Shanghai to other places that might not have the
                            same tempting potential. Attending to this contrast in more detail,
                            German school student Andrea makes a clear distinction between the
                            &#8220;Dorfkneipen&#8221; (country pubs) she knows from Germany and the
                            restaurants she enjoys frequenting in Shanghai.</p>

                            my young informants either enjoy the cab ride home or go to the next
                            location. Further clubs such as Dada (a university student location),
                            Shelter (Shanghai&#8217;s &#8220;underground&#8221; venue in an old bomb

                            of a high-rise building that maintains guest lists and strict dress

                        <p>While the social aesthetics of Shanghai&#8217;s internationalized
                            nightclub scene prescribes a certain way of dressing, specific
                            practices, and financial means, the clubs do not enforce a minimum age
                            rule. Expatriate teenagers thus negotiate access to these spaces, which
                            would be off limits in most of their &#8220;home&#8221; countries, with
                            their parents alone. The students successively acquire certain routine
                            practices through regular club visits with their friends. While Farrer

                                and Field 2012</xref>) have convincingly argued that these nightlife
                            spaces in Shanghai serve as ethnosexual contact zones between locals and
                            expatriates, expatriate adolescents use Shanghai&#8217;s bars and clubs
                            primarily to manifest their age, gender, cosmopolitan, and urban
                            identities, as well as to strengthen their friendships. Furthermore,
                            nights out provide the counterpart to an otherwise structured school
                            life with its associated pressure. As Northcote (<xref rid="ID61dbb008-1c7a-4e73-875c-4d073dbb62bb" ref-type="bibr" id="ID660f3c5b-cef5-4705-aa56-14a806ebf268">2006</xref>) suggests,
                            youths&#8217; nightlife practices can be seen as small, self-made rites
                            of passage. In other words, nightlife offers a space for transformation
                            through repeat practices in a space that is also shared with adults.
                            These manifold transformations in nightlife spaces, however, are not
                            only concerned with being mature or entering adulthood, but also with
                            enjoying and preserving their youth. The communal process of claiming
                            youth and independence through partying is also accompanied by processes
                            of claiming urbanity (through choosing downtown nightlife locations) and
                            cosmopolitanism (through choosing to share a space with international
                            clubbers). Moreover, gender performances are brought to the fore and the
                            students&#8217; first romantic and sexual encounters often take place
                            within this setting. Here, the network of the peer group provides a
                            sense of safety. Simultaneously, these friendships are strengthened
                            through the repetition of collective experiences. Like a stage offers
                            room for performance but also for (temporary) transformations,
                            Shanghai&#8217;s clubs provide a space for teenagers to practice and
                            explore these new narratives of the self. The meanings attributed to
                            nightlife practices are central to their involvement with the city. By
                            making weekends special and allowing them to claim new spaces for
                            themselves, both collectively and without their families, these routines
                            are a mechanism by which they adapt to the move to Shanghai.
                            Shanghai&#8217;s nightscapes therefore stage expatriate youth culture
                            and its emplacement in the city based on the participants&#8217; own
                            agency. It is, in other words, primarily nightlife that helps teenagers
                            transform their enclaved experiences in the schools and compounds into
                            more desirable young urban identities.</p>

                <title>Chapter 3: The Shop: Hanging Out</title>
                <p>While the previous chapter provided one example of expatriate youths&#8217;
                    agency in creating their own routines and social spaces within Shanghai&#8217;s
                    global nightlife culture, this chapter examines another space and its related
                    practices: the shop.</p>
                <p>Students in grade ten or above at the German and French school campus are allowed
                    to leave the school premises during the school day. The older students make use
                    of this privilege during breaks or free periods and often have lunch outside.
                    Consequently, it is not surprising that a French caf&#233; and a German bakery
                    are nearby, offering familiar flavors to the schools&#8217; staff, students, and
                    their families. The students, however, are particularly attracted to a small
                    street in the vicinity of campus that hosts Chinese eateries and small shops
                    selling cheap dishes, snacks, and drinks.</p>
                <sec>
                    <title> 3.1. &#8220;The shop is our place to chill&#8221; </title>
                    <p>Here, in a narrow alley a five-minute walk from the school campus, students
                        can get cheap drinks, purchase a lunch of fried rice or noodles, or simply
                        hang out. The street differs from the surrounding gated communities and the
                        other caf&#233;s and bakeries that are located near the school. The small
                        alley is separated by a wall from the main street that runs parallel to it.
                        When entering the lane, students are suddenly welcomed by a different
                        atmosphere. Shabbier houses, makeshift stalls, new and broken pool tables,
                        laundry hanging out to dry, women cleaning vegetables, and smells of fried
                        food present a world entirely different from the school campus that was just
                        left around the corner. The students refer to this lane, along with all its
                        offerings and atmosphere, simply as &#8220;the shop&#8221; (Figure 24).</p>
                    <p>The shop has undoubtedly become part of the students&#8217; everyday life.

                            <p> <italic>The shop close to the school is our place to chill. Well, at least
                                it used to be. We went, I went there five times a week during lunch
                                break. I bought something to eat, for example gongbao or something
                                else</italic>. 
                                <italic>Karina refers to the traditional Chinese gong bao ji ding, a
                                chicken dish with peanuts, garlic, and chillies. It is incredibly
                                tasty and pretty cheap.
                                 But a huge portion. They really cook well.
                                Although, if you closely look at the environment, pretty shabby,
                                then you think, concerning hygiene, you rather don&#8217;t want to
                                eat there. But it is really good. At the shop most students buy
                                something to drink, bread rolls, sweets, chewing gum. It&#8217;s our
                                provider.</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1244">28</xref><xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1258">29</xref></p>

                    <p>The shop provides a place to &#8220;chill&#8221; during lunch break, to
                        recharge for further lessons and activities. The English word
                        &#8220;chilling,&#8221; which teenagers adapted to German grammar as
                        &#8220;chillen,&#8221; refers to specific practices of &#8220;hanging
                        out&#8221; and seems to have spread among youths of various nationalities.

                                stands for meeting up with friends in a very &#8220;relaxed&#8221;

                                physical activity games (football, teasing each other, etc.), or
                                even playing party games. Essential for &#8220;chilling&#8221; is
                                that it is an activity you do with friends and not with parents.</p>

                        related to places such as their friends&#8217; homes or the shop.</p>
                    <p>The importance of these spaces for teenagers has also been proven in other

                                teenagers. Where such public spaces were available near the school,
                                teenagers stayed much longer after school. School environments
                                lacking such public domain or surrounded by traffic spaces, were
                                emptied within 10 minutes after the courses (<xref rid="ID6a0770ec-8bc7-4876-bf83-8c4d7806bd0f" ref-type="bibr" id="ID18bfa2e4-b26a-4623-80a8-083538d7299b">Vanderstede 2011,

                    <p>The shop&#8217;s appeal as a hangout place is thus, first of all, connected
                        to its proximity to the school and the space it provides for recreation and
                        meeting friends during and immediately after school. At the same time, being
                        at the shop confirms the expatriate teenagers&#8217; status as &#8220;older
                        students,&#8221; which they can express through taking advantage of the
                        privilege to leave campus during school time. The shop is therefore also an
                        age-specific experience that, unlike the school cafeteria and the
                        schoolyard, does not need to be shared with younger children.</p>

                    <p>While many students regularly eat out at foreign restaurants with their
                        families or friends (see Part III, Chapter 1), the food in the small alley
                        is, for many expatriate youths, the only local food they consume except for
                        dishes prepared at home by their ayi (see Part III, Chapter 2.2). Students
                        point out that the shop is obviously &#8220;more Chinese&#8221; than their
                        other everyday spaces such as the compounds or their schools. Here, some of
                        them have their only regular contact with locals, as sixteen-year-old Bjorn
                        explains.</p>

                    <p>While it is true that the little street is frequented by Chinese locals, the
                        fact that the shopkeepers have responded to the desires of the foreign
                        students is immediately apparent: their inventory, for instance, includes
                        foreign candy such as imported Haribo gummy bears, which I had never seen in
                        any other small, Chinese-run shops in Shanghai.</p>
                    <p>The shop-owners have also set up pool tables in the street and put a small
                        stereo outside where students can plug in their mp3 players to play their
                        favorite songs. Furthermore, European students&#8212;as some of the
                        teenagers shared with me&#8212;have actively shaped the spaces themselves by
                        putting graffiti on the walls (Figure 26a).</p>
                    <p>Figure 26. The Shop. a) Pool Tables, Graffiti, and Laundry, January 2011; b)
                        Use of Pool Table to Display Wares. Photos by M. Sander.</p>
                    <p>However, the local shopkeepers still use the spaces according to their own
                        needs. They often play pool themselves, use the tables to prepare food or
                        display wares for the local community, or hang their laundry to air-dry
                        outside (see Figure 26b).</p>
                    <p>The shop thus offers a venue for experiencing the locale. It is also,
                        according to the students, a place that is more in touch with the local
                        Chinese population than any of the other places they frequent. They share
                        the pool tables; they eat at the same restaurant. While the relations
                        between shop-owners and students clearly maintain the distance between
                        customer and service provider, the students, shop-owners, and their families
                        also share a common leisure space by playing pool, sitting outside, eating,
                        smoking, chatting, and relaxing together. The shop is no longer
                        &#8220;typically local&#8221; nor is it, as Antonia pointed out in the
                        interview, a well-groomed &#8220;expat&#8221; space; it sits in-between. </p>
                    <p>This in-betweenness also resonates with the students&#8217; own entangled
                        claims of cultural identification and the process of gaining transcultural
                        perspectives (see Introduction). The shop as an in-between space invites its
                        actors to adopt a transcultural perspective with site-specific knowledge,
                        which I myself as a researcher had to acquire in the same manner as the
                        students. This phase of learning to navigate the area included, for
                        instance, becoming familiar enough with the menu of the little restaurant to
                        order their dishes in Chinese, knowing when and where to sit, or knowing how
                        much items cost in the small shop.</p>

                        economic and political power have the greatest opportunity to shape public
                        culture by controlling the building of the city&#8217;s public spaces in

                        finds that &#8220;public space is inherently democratic. The question of who
                        can occupy public space, and so define an image of the city, is
                        open-ended&#8221; (<xref rid="ID217d112b-f5a8-41c6-8db1-ccdd3167a104" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdeb77cee-84c2-44e2-b5c7-24cd7e08a43e">ibid.</xref>). Zukin suggests, therefore, that public culture is</p>
                    <p>produced by the many social encounters that make up daily life in the
                        streets, shops, and parks&#8212;the spaces in which we experience public
                        life in cities. The right to be in these spaces, to use them in certain
                        ways, to invest them with a sense of our selves and our communities&#8212;to
                        claim them as ours and to be claimed in turn by them&#8212;make up a
                        constantly changing public culture (<xref rid="ID217d112b-f5a8-41c6-8db1-ccdd3167a104" ref-type="bibr" id="ID4dadc411-cd71-4cd1-85ff-ba21a0ebad5a">ibid.</xref>). </p>

                        even small public spaces like the shop can be seen as part of
                        Shanghai&#8217;s larger public culture. </p>

                        the term &#8220;open space&#8221; (offener Raum) instead of &#8220;public
                        space&#8221; to describe areas like the shop. He finds the notion of
                        &#8220;public space&#8221; ill-fitting for the situation in Chinese urban
                        politics because it relates to western norms of democracy, participation,
                        and civil society (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3e640a62-4b01-48a3-9ae6-6b8864bf64d9">ibid.,

                            31</xref>). Hassenpflug&#8217;s examples of how &#8220;open space&#8221;
                        is used and claimed are immediately familiar to every Shanghai visitor: the
                        laundry line on the sidewalk, people going for a stroll in their pajamas, or
                        people playing go&#8212;a Chinese game similar to chess. All these practices
                        fall within the realm of what might be considered the &#8220;private
                        space&#8221; in Western cities. It is with the understanding of such
                        &#8220;open space&#8221; that the Chinese shop-owners use the little alley
                        of the shop: there, they clean vegetables, dry laundry, and sit outside with
                        friends, neighbors, and family members. </p>
                    <p>The dualism of &#8220;closed&#8221; and &#8220;open&#8221; space is visible
                        in the expatriate teenagers&#8217; spatial practices as well. Bjorn&#8217;s
                        mental map, for instance, highlights the students&#8217; movements from one
                        &#8220;closed space&#8221; to the next (Figure 27). </p>
                    <p>The locations displayed on this map are almost all closed and restrict entry
                        based on financial means (the nightclub, restaurant) or limit access to
                        those who already have a specific affiliation with the place (housing areas,
                        school). The only two &#8220;open spaces&#8221; that Bjorn placed on his map
                        of Shanghai are the People&#8217;s Square and the shop. Shanghai&#8217;s
                        central People&#8217;s Square, however, is less of a space to stay than a
                        place of transit, due to its many intersecting metro lines. Bjorn&#8217;s
                        use of arrows in his drawing also suggests the transitory role of the
                        square, as the arrow simply crosses through it, rather than pointing
                        directly at the unit. If we contextualize the experience of the shop in
                        these larger, everyday spatial experiences, the shop&#8212;despite its own
                        rules or access regulations prescribed by the school&#8212;appears as one of
                        the few &#8220;open spaces&#8221; the teenagers use. </p>

                    <p>I argue that it is this openness, and the fact that this liminal space
                        provides them with the freedom and flexibility to simply hang out, that
                        attracts the students most. Bjorn explains the usage of the shop by
                        comparing it to public spaces in Germany. In his comparison, however, he
                        chooses public spaces that&#8212;similar to Hassenpflug&#8217;s depiction of
                        &#8220;open space&#8221; in Chinese cities&#8212;can be claimed by hanging
                        out in them communally, by listening to music or drinking beer:</p>

                            <p> For me, the shop is somewhat like a park; or what a bus stop or a
                                playground is for youths in Germany. Practically speaking, that is
                                what the shop is. There are no problems with disturbances or breach
                                of the peace. [&#8230;] You come here, bring your stuff along. Sit
                                down on the pool tables and drink. You listen to music. Everything
                                is allowed. It&#8217;s like a public place in my opinion, where

                    <p>The shop, in contrast to the guarded housing compounds as Bjorn suggests, is
                        an &#8220;open space&#8221; that, for him, stands for freedom and escape
                        from strict rules or even surveillance. </p>
                    <p>Bjorn&#8217;s description of the shop is also reminiscent of Hugh
                        Matthews&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID1eeee0bd-75ea-4160-a328-012659fc07bc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDbc18c459-d3c7-4229-a445-241f4a04c3d8">2003</xref>)

                        understands these spaces as &#8220;the street,&#8221; a metaphor he
                        introduces to generally refer to &#8216;&#8216;all outdoor spaces within the
                        public domain.&#8221; According to Matthews, the street &#8220;acts as a
                        liminal setting or a site of passage, a place which both makes possible and
                        signifies a means of transition through which some young people move away
                        from the restrictions of their childhood roots towards the independence of
                        adulthood&#8221; (<xref rid="ID1eeee0bd-75ea-4160-a328-012659fc07bc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDe8f43312-26d1-4a86-bb0b-72bd1a1b3f3d">ibid.</xref>). </p>
                    <p>Matthews&#8217; idea of streets adds another dimension to spaces like the
                        shop, that Hassenpflug&#8217;s helpful, albeit limiting division of open and
                        closed spaces does not address: the age-specific experience. For youths,
                        streets are places where, according to Matthews (<xref rid="ID1eeee0bd-75ea-4160-a328-012659fc07bc" ref-type="bibr" id="ID09aeec90-21d8-49d0-98af-472963afdf0c">2003, 106</xref>),
                        &#8220;adultist conventions and moralities about what it is to be a
                        child&#8212;that is, less-than-adult&#8212;can be put aside.&#8221; The
                        concept of streets therefore also highlights the liminal stage of youth in
                        society:</p>

                                selfhood. In essence, therefore, streets can be grouped among those
                                places where the newness of hybrid identities, no longer a child not
                                yet adult, may be articulated (<xref rid="ID1eeee0bd-75ea-4160-a328-012659fc07bc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb2647e47-5b1c-42fa-8c1c-8f78ada8ebc8">ibid.</xref>).</p>

                        students&#8217; ways of hanging out there and using the area as an open
                        space or, more age-specifically, as a liminal space&#8212;as a street
                        (Figures 28 and 29).</p>
                    <p>The students describe the shop as dirty and run-down, but chilled. They can
                        draw graffiti, listen to music, and play pool. It is a place more
                        organically grown than the carefully designed schools, compounds, and
                        nightclubs. Students do not do any homework or study there, but socialize in
                        a way that is less restricted than their interactions at school or in
                        nightclubs. It is the only space they visit during the week that is outside
                        the school and the expat compound. This little street&#8212;also

                    <p>The shop generally serves as an &#8220;open space&#8221; in Hassenpflug's
                            (<xref rid="IDac11bed5-cfdc-443b-850d-417269d0b4a7" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa32fc9fd-00a0-411f-826e-d2fc82b34d96">2009</xref>) definition, one
                        which the local Chinese residents and the expatriate students of the German
                        and French school campus nearby communally use and shape. For these youths
                        in particular, however, the shop can best be understood in Matthew&#8217;s
                            (<xref rid="ID1eeee0bd-75ea-4160-a328-012659fc07bc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb5ed1963-2517-44a6-854f-96e1eac0d13c">2003</xref>) terms as
                        &#8220;the street,&#8221; a site of passage where they need not follow
                        behavior conventions and can articulate their age-specific identities as
                        youths. Because the German students see this alley as a place to take a
                        break from school or hang out, the shop offers a feeling of freedom in
                        contrast to the rather sealed-off and surveilled spaces where they spend
                        most of their time. Whether and when students are allowed to go to the shop,
                        however, is still negotiated with the school authorities. At the same time,
                        through these negotiations, the shop confirms the students&#8217;
                        age-identities, namely the privilege of leaving campus during school hours.
                        The shop is a place for teenagers, not elementary school students, and can
                        be seen as a liminal space where one can still be young while moving away
                        from childhood roots, as Matthews&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID1eeee0bd-75ea-4160-a328-012659fc07bc" ref-type="bibr" id="IDed73ce81-92dd-47d8-b6e6-2d02b9452951">2003</xref>) understanding
                        of similar spaces highlights.</p>
                    <p>The German teenagers also describe the shop as one of the few spaces that
                        they share with Chinese locals (and one of the rare sites of interaction
                        with them). The owners of the small eateries and stores, viewing the little
                        street as &#8220;open space,&#8221; tolerate the students&#8217; behaviors
                        of cycling, listening to music, or even spraying graffiti. The youths&#8217;
                        practices at the shop have developed from a tacit compromise with the
                        shop-owners, who see the teenagers&#8217; presence as an opportunity to
                        enhance their business and subsequently provide pool tables, couches, snacks
                        the students know from home, and even a stereo where they can play their own
                        music. At the same time, the shop owners and residents themselves also
                        utilize the area as a leisure space. In this way, the shop is, in the
                        students&#8217; words, &#8220;not expat,&#8221; and carries another
                        dimension of liminality or in-betweenness, thus fostering the development of
                        transcultural perspectives. The students&#8217; practices are consequently
                        not only negotiated with the school nearby, but also with the shop-owners.
                        Nonetheless, the teenagers&#8212;despite their friendly conversation and
                        interactions with them&#8212;also remain customers. The concluding chapter
                        of this part therefore focuses on the emplacement processes of expatriate
                        youths in Shanghai and further examines the students&#8217; relations to
                        Shanghai&#8217;s &#8220;local&#8221; citizens.</p>

                <p>Donald and Gammack suggest a general atmosphere of Shanghai, a &#8220;sense of

                    the chapters of the previous part, &#8220;Arriving,&#8221; I have shown that
                    many of the places teenage expatriates routinely frequent, such as schools and
                    housing areas, are secluded and not even considered part of the city by the
                    students themselves (see Part II, Chapter 1, on managing Shanghai by dividing it
                    into &#8220;the city&#8221; and familiar spaces). Students and their families
                    draw strong boundaries around their expatriate circles and their contact with
                    local Chinese is very limited. Consequently, Shanghai&#8217;s citizens have
                    remained rather absent in my accounts tracing the youths&#8217; everyday
                    practices. However, the question arises if this absence is only due to the
                    boundaries expatriates create as a means of making distinctions and finding
                    comfort and community. What role, if any, do the &#8220;principles of
                    exclusion&#8221; Donald and Gammack attribute to Shanghai play in the lack of
                    interaction between expatriate and Chinese youths? </p>

                    &#8220;locals.&#8221; Applying her analytical concept to my work allows me to
                    focus on the relations between the two heterogeneous groups, expatriates and

                    chapter investigates this &#8220;diaspora space&#8221; by exploring the
                    relationships between expatriate teenagers and China or Chinese citizens, to
                    further understand the boundaries I have observed and described throughout this
                    ethnography. It also highlights how the students perceive their (lack of)
                    interaction with Chinese citizens and how they position themselves within the
                    greater context of Shanghai and China.</p>
                <p>Since &#8220;diaspora space&#8221; as an abstract theoretical concept was
                    ill-suited for the interview discussions, I simply asked students if they felt
                    accepted in China. The teenagers reflected on their relationship to Chinese
                    society, at which point I brought the term &#8220;integration&#8221; into the
                    discussion. It became obvious that, for many of the students, the term
                    &#8220;integration&#8221; had never been used in relation to their situations,
                    but remained something they saw as reserved for less privileged migrants in
                    Europe or elsewhere. Based on these new reflections on integration, and by
                    tracing their views on the role of the expatriate community and what expatriate
                    status means for them, this chapter investigates the relationship these youths
                    felt they had with Shanghai itself (4.1). It then draws attention to a topic
                    that emerged during interviews&#8212;the teenagers&#8217; experiences of
                    &#8220;not fitting in,&#8221; of being visibly foreign in the city (4.2).
                    Subsequently, to shed further light on the &#8220;diaspora space,&#8221; I
                    examine the barriers to integration that the students perceived, as well as the
                    difficulty they had making connections with Chinese youths (4.3). Finally, this
                    chapter explores students&#8217; subjective views of the attitude of Chinese
                    authorities toward foreigners (4.4) and shows how integration and feelings of
                    being accepted in China, according to these students&#8217; experiences, can
                    only go so far as being welcomed as &#8220;a guest&#8221; (4.5).</p>

                        &#8220;inner&#8221; definitions are tied to the way in which expatriates
                        consider themselves to be separate from China, which becomes visible when
                        discussing the idea of &#8220;integration&#8221; with students. </p>

                    <p>Giovanni&#8217;s description of being able to remain independent from local
                        Chinese or, &#8220;the others,&#8221; in his words, seems based on a clear
                        sense of a divide between &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them.&#8221; His
                        opinion likely derives from the observation that relationships across this
                        divide usually center merely around service or business, and not around
                        casual encounters or friendships as his usage of &#8220;need&#8221;
                        suggests. Giovanni&#8217;s statement also startles me, as he does not seem
                        at all curious about meeting any Chinese people. When I inquire further
                        about the process of integration, he comments: </p>

                        functions (to a large extent) independently of Chinese society. This image
                        of an autonomous community is based on maintaining a unifying and comforting
                        experience for its members, but is simultaneously linked to establishing

                    <p>Andrea, like Paul, uses the metaphor of the &#8220;bubble&#8221; to describe
                        the expatriate experience in Shanghai. Furthermore, she stresses that
                        foreigners in China have, in her words, &#8220;this special&#8221; and
                        &#8220;very different status.&#8221; Andrea, familiar with expat postings
                        elsewhere, considers this foreigner status not only as &#8220;special&#8221;
                        in comparison to that of the local Chinese, but also to expatriates
                        elsewhere:</p>

                            <p><italic> I don&#8217;t know, but I find the expats here are different
                                from expats in Singapore, or in Spain or somewhere; the foreigners,
                                the German expats. Because here it is still, here it is still very
                                different. Here, you still have a driver, here you also don&#8217;t
                                have to learn the language. I don&#8217;t know, but if you as a
                                German go to Mexico, and you work there, you have to learn Spanish.
                                I think, in my opinion. And when I go to Singapore, then it is not
                                like that either. [&#8230;] If you are lucky, you get a car, I
                                think. That&#8217;s what I heard, from friends, but not everyone
                                gets one. It is much more expensive.</italic>

                    <p>In Andrea&#8217;s view, the status of expatriates in Shanghai is different
                        from that of expatriates elsewhere due to the financial benefits and clear
                        difference between the average local income and that of expats. Andrea
                        argues that this status has an influence on the relationships between
                        foreigners and local Chinese: expats do not even have to learn Chinese. </p>

                    <p>Although I do not present my own critical stance on certain aspects of
                        expatriate ways of life during interviews, Antonia&#8217;s self-critique
                        might be triggered by my presence and the questions I raise about
                        integration. Nonetheless, her reflections on her own lifestyle and the
                        implications of status leading to expatriates &#8220;feeling better than all
                        the others,&#8221; show the discomfort she feels regarding the relationship
                        between foreigners and locals. She also identifies the different financial
                        means as a dividing experience and points out that expatriates might be
                        welcome mainly due to their high spending power. Although she criticizes
                        expatriates&#8217; attitudes towards China as well as what other students
                        present as a &#8220;special status,&#8221; she can also relate to the
                        experience of such a status. She argues that, in her experience, the Chinese
                        always treat her as a foreigner in the sense that she is something special,
                        and that this treatment inevitably hinders friendships:</p>

                    <p>Antonia&#8217;s argument, that the positive discrimination she experiences
                        impedes integration, can be applied to her fellow students
                        &#8217;experiences as well. During our discussion at the mall in Xujiahui,
                        Giovanni, who once interned as a teacher at a Chinese sailing school,
                        recalls how he felt that his presence was welcome merely due to the
                        status-gain the sailing club hoped to achieve by having a (white) foreigner
                        among their staff:</p>

                                not to teach them, but rather, that [the customers] see that there
                                are also foreigners. That was my feeling.</italic>

                    <p>This experience of being presented as a foreigner to make a Chinese
                        enterprise look more international goes hand-in-hand with the
                        teenagers&#8217;perceptions of being treated with respect due to their
                        physical appearance. Giovanni, however, would have liked to pursue a more
                        meaningful role at the sailing school. </p>

                            <p><italic>[Expatriates] often see China as a country where they go for a
                                few years and then leave again. And I think people often don&#8217;t
                                really respect the country. They feel they can get away with things
                                they would never do in Germany. Because they think they have a
                                special status because they are foreigners. It is so different here.
                                In Germany, if you are a foreigner, it is not necessarily regarded
                                as positive. And here it is like that. They get excited about
                                foreigners&#8212; &#8220;Oh, foreigners!&#8221; and so on&#8212;and
                                are happy about it and, sometimes, even get special treatment or
                                something. My dad caused an accident once, a small one. And then he
                                had to show his passport at the police station. And then: &#8220;Oh
                                my God, he is German.&#8221; And so on. [&#8230;] And in Germany you

                        looks Chinese, Don often experiences differences in the way Chinese
                        &#8220;locals&#8221; view him in contrast to his white friends, who are
                        immediately identifiable as foreigners:</p>

                                friends, so to speak. They all look, well, tall-built and western.
                                And when you walk through the streets with them, and when we get in
                                trouble, then it&#8217;s most often the Chinese who get dissed
                                first. As a Chinese, if you look Chinese, you generally get less
                                respect from the Chinese. They respect foreigners to the

                    <p>In summary, expatriate students feel they have a &#8220;special status in
                        Shanghai&#8221; and are often treated differently from Chinese citizens.
                        Some of the students&#8217; descriptions can even be labeled as cases of
                        positive discrimination. This is particularly true for those who are
                        identifiable as foreign at first sight. Many of the students echo
                        Don&#8217;s above account of the Chinese citizens&#8217;
                        &#8220;respect&#8221; for foreigners, and for white people in particular.
                        The next section further explores the role of the expatriate students&#8217;
                        physical differences from or similarities to the Chinese, and how either
                        affects their experience in Shanghai. While it further elaborates upon the
                        privileged status of whiteness, it also examines the white high school
                        students&#8217; experiences of &#8220;not fitting in,&#8221; as well as the
                        constant gaze of the &#8220;other.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>&#8220;Being a migrant is, amongst other things, a profoundly bodily
                        experience&#8221; (Fechter 2007b, 60). Consequently, for many expatriate
                        students, the difference between their bodies and those of the
                        Chinese&#8212;namely their &#8220;whiteness&#8221;&#8212;plays a crucial
                        role. Whiteness has recently come into focus among scholars, who explore the
                        cultural construction of whiteness and challenge it as an unexamined and
                        unmarked category (Hill <xref rid="ID63b9d1a5-20d3-4245-a8f2-ec8d403bf8d8" ref-type="bibr" id="IDb3ece09a-85f0-43fe-a349-931fc701271b">1997</xref>). Whiteness as examined in these studies, is summarized by
                        Donald (2000, 157) who in turn draws on Richard Dyer&#8217;s White ([<xref rid="ID443ba1d0-623e-4f24-b80b-606b541d6f1d" ref-type="bibr" id="ID601c6b98-8fe5-4255-b528-2097e75f2e6f">1997</xref>] 2008), as
                        &#8220;a racial category; generally understood as a construction of
                        privilege in many political, social, and economic environments.&#8221;
                        Whiteness is not only seen as a bodily difference in regard to skin color,
                        but the perceived difference also includes height, overall stature, hair
                        texture, or eye shape. &#8220;White&#8221; therefore does not stand for skin
                        color alone, but for an intricate web of aspects, as Dyer highlights:</p>

                                complexions are so distinct from that of white Westerners; it is
                                generally the shape of the eyes that is critical in deciding whether

                        attracting stares depended on the context and my mood. Re-reading my field
                        diary from 2007, when I had commented more frequently on being the object of
                        the gaze than during my stays between 2010 and 2012, my own desire to be
                        able to blend in, to not be immediately visible as a &#8220;stranger&#8221;
                        is apparent. This experience relates to Stephanie Donald&#8217;s point that
                        we are unaware of our white ethnicity due to the perceived normality and
                        status it often brings along: &#8220;The bearers of whiteness so often
                        pretend to neutrality. We refuse our ethnicity, while playing on its

                    <p>This becoming visible as &#8220;white,&#8221; which I often found disturbing,
                        can be understood in the context of Richard Dyer&#8217;s argument, that
                        &#8220;Whites must be seen to be white, yet whiteness as race resides in
                        invisible properties and whiteness as power is maintained by being unseen.
                        To be seen as white is to have one&#8217;s corporeality registered, yet true
                        whiteness resides in the non-corporeal&#8221; (Dyer [<xref rid="ID443ba1d0-623e-4f24-b80b-606b541d6f1d" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa749849b-a6a5-4a0c-9c2a-a5835fcdb263">1997</xref>] 2008, 45).</p>
                    <p>Dyer&#8217;s description of losing power through being registered as white

                        teenagers&#8217; feeling unsettled by the locals&#8217; stares. In a manner
                        similar to my early experiences, Britta, who is Norwegian, describes how it

                    <p>In addition to the sudden awareness of corporeality, my ethnographic material
                        on expatriate women gathered in 2007, and an article by Willis and Yeoh

                        &#8220;Bridget Jones in China&#8221; was commonly reported to be a term by
                        which women referred to themselves. Some, for example, reported Chinese

                        manicures, pedicures, and facials are also very common among adult white

                        their attractiveness is questioned. Nevertheless, buying clothes in China

                    <p>These experiences of physical difference play an important role in the
                        migration process. Evidently, these white youths&#8217; experiences of
                        Shanghai are significantly affected by the stares and other reactions they
                        receive from Shanghai&#8217;s Chinese citizens. To some extent, such
                        reactions may, by highlighting the importance of whiteness, reaffirm the
                        impact white skin still has. However, the stares can also be unsetteling and
                        thus curb the power usually attributed to whiteness; their physical
                        difference becomes a state which the teenage expats cannot escape, because
                        blending in is impossible. A thorough discussion of the intricate issue of
                        race and racism in Shanghai, however, is beyond the scope of this study and
                        would require research on and input from the Chinese perspective. In my
                        fieldwork, however, I focused on the subjective experiences among expatriate
                        youths and merely aim to point out how their physical appearance influences
                        their practices in Shanghai.</p>

                                exhausting here. Well, in part it is really exhausting. Because of
                                all the traffic, all the people here. And that is inevitable. And
                                the problem is also that I haven&#8217;t mastered the language at
                                all. And I don&#8217;t like that. First of all, everyone looks at
                                you. That might be normal. You look different from them and many
                                others in their environment.</italic>

                    <p>Peter&#8217;s remark that &#8220;life is very exhausting here&#8221; stands
                        in stark contrast to the comfort of expatriate life that students usually
                        describe. However, Peter&#8217;s account delineates expatriate life from
                        what lies outside the &#8220;bubble&#8221; and, at the same time, points to
                        the factors that contribute to its creation and maintenance, as well as the
                        expats&#8217; withdrawal into it. Britta also explains her encounter with
                        this phenomenon:</p>

                            <p> Also it is nice when you go to places where you see other western
                                people. Like, you don't feel like the only one who is blond in the
                                whole building. You can, like, look around and see, maybe they are
                                American or German.</p>

                    <p>The experience of being white therefore clearly shapes the ways expatriates
                        create and define spaces for themselves. The physical walls that protect the
                        gated communities or international schools and the boundaries around the
                        body&#8212;namely, cultural constructions of whiteness&#8212;often support
                        each other. Fechter has identified similar experiences among expatriates in
                        Indonesia (<xref rid="ID0bbd646f-0e84-4833-a4f4-421f9698f34e" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9e73cdf0-9f0d-402f-a573-23ea6e7c9602">2007b,

                                In particular, many expatriates feel rather uncomfortable being
                                looked at by Indonesians, and their wish to avoid this &#8220;gaze
                                of the Other&#8221; therefore informs many of their spatial
                                practices (<xref rid="ID0bbd646f-0e84-4833-a4f4-421f9698f34e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDa7f8c487-f0c4-4529-9d96-fb235c9e9d7b">ibid., 67</xref>).</p>

                    <p>Thus not only their own view of the city, but also the process of being
                        viewed, shapes the ways expatriates respond to these urban landscapes and
                        might be one of their many motives behind avoiding certain spaces&#8212;such
                        as the subway&#8212;and embracing others, such as nightclubs or bars.</p>

                        of &#8220;western&#8221; for white &#8220;may be true in both the
                        imaginations of expatriates and those they come into contact with.&#8221;
                        However, while expatriates are usually imagined as &#8220;western&#8221; and
                        &#8220;white&#8221;&#8212;these terms are often used
                        interchangeably&#8212;not all expatriates fit into these catergories. Many
                        expatriates in Shanghai are not &#8220;western&#8221; at all and may come
                        from other parts of Asia (as was the case for the majority of the students
                        at the Singaporean school I visited). Furthermore, a considerable number of
                        the expatriate students who consider themselves &#8220;western,&#8221; such
                        as those who come from Germany, are not white. While I only interviewed one
                        black girl at the Singaporean school and did not accompany any black
                        expatriate students in Shanghai, I met many students of Asian descent who
                        had a Chinese parent or grandparents who had migrated to Europe or North
                        America from Hong Kong, Mainland China, or other parts of Asia decades
                        before the student&#8217;s family relocated to Shanghai. These children form
                        a large percentage of the students at all of the international schools and
                        their experiences in Shanghai differ substantially from those of their peers
                        who are perceived as &#8220;white.&#8221; </p>
                    <p>While Don, born to Chinese parents in Germany, for instance, voices his anger
                        about being treated differently by the guards at the gated communities (see
                        Part III, Chapter 2), other students with a more Chinese appearance stress
                        that their ability to blend in is positive. French school student Arnaud,
                        for instance, describes his freedom to play with being an expat or not:</p>

                    <p>Although the ways students experience physical differences encourages them to

                        is inadequate for explaining the local-expat divide. To further investigate
                        this &#8220;diaspora space,&#8221; the entangled relations between
                        expatriates and Shanghai&#8217;s citizens, I return to the expatriate

                        forming balanced relationships with local youths.</p>

                        influential edited volume Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, Fredrik Barth
                            ([<xref rid="IDecea7aef-3ce2-4829-a87f-c5875646859b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID282a66b2-224e-4a14-b5f9-29deff03536f">1969</xref>] 1998) proposed
                        that boundaries and barriers between groups are worth close examination
                        because it is &#8220;the ethnic boundary that defines the group, not the
                        cultural stuff that it encloses&#8221; (Barth [<xref rid="IDecea7aef-3ce2-4829-a87f-c5875646859b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID38db51fe-9eb2-405a-814b-4fe14f7f1175">1969</xref>] 1998, 15).
                        While this might seem like an overemphasis on the role of barriers, I
                        believe that perceptions and practices surrounding boundary drawing should
                        be investigated not least because this is a focus that has also been
                        promoted in the realm of transcultural studies. As I have put forth in the
                        Introduction, constant negotiation between creating boundaries and crossing
                        them takes place in culturally-entangled environments. To explore new
                        surroundings and unknown practices does not necessarily erase but may even
                        provoke the desire to create distinct spaces of familiarity. Therefore,
                        drawing on both Nadig (2004) and P&#252;tz (2004), and their ideas of
                        transculturality in progress and as practice, I highlighted the relevance of
                        the processes and practices of drawing cultural boundaries to our
                        understanding of transcultural relations. Consequently, this subchapter
                        explores the students&#8217; articulations and perceptions of boundaries
                        within the &#8220;diaspora space&#8221; that hinder encounters between
                        expatriate and &#8220;local&#8221; youths. </p>
                    <p>When I introduce the term &#8220;integration&#8221; during several
                        interviews, it promptly triggers contemplation about what
                        &#8220;integration&#8221; might mean, and students often aim to apply the
                        idea to their own social worlds in Shanghai. At the same time, these
                        discussions implicitly show how the youths perceive such borders, as
                        seventeen-year-old Karina&#8217;s definition of &#8220;integration&#8221;

                        stay in Shanghai. While some students keep studying Chinese, many find it
                        too challenging and abandon their efforts. Some students who have a native
                        Chinese parent already have language proficiency, but the differences in
                        dialect can make it difficult even for them to understand Shanghainese
                        citizens. Furthermore, all of the parents of Chinese descent have a good
                        command of the language spoken at their children&#8217;s school. Charlie,
                        for example, describes how her parents occasionally talk to her and her
                        sister in Chinese, but that the two usually answer in German. Don, who
                        speaks a Chinese dialect with his parents, judges his Chinese as &#8220;not
                        so good&#8221; and considers learning Chinese extremely difficult for
                        foreigners in general:</p>

                            <p><italic>And I also believe that foreigners, as such, that they cannot
                                really achieve it, to learn Chinese. Well, I myself had problems. In
                                the beginning, I really studied a lot, Chinese. Nothing stays.
                                It&#8217;s really&#8212;you have to study every day. Every day. And
                                no foreigner here at the school does that.</italic>

                    <p>While many of the students at the German school actually enroll in the
                        Chinese language classes the school offers as part of their curriculum, the
                        time most students spend studying, as Don points out, is not sufficient to
                        achieve a good conversational level or the ability to read Chinese
                        characters adequately. Then again, other students who are proficient in
                        Chinese demonstrate that language skills&#8212;though helpful&#8212;do not
                        necessarily enable friendships across the local-expat divide.</p>

                                Chinese friends. When I think about it, that isn&#8217;t normal,
                                usually, living in a foreign country and not knowing the people in
                                that country. [&#8230;] It is even stranger if you, for instance,
                                take [student&#8217;s name]. He has been living in Shanghai for
                                eleven years now. In China. And doesn&#8217;t know a word, hardly
                                any Chinese. He could live here perfectly for eleven years without
                                speaking Chinese. That shows how little we are integrated. You
                                don&#8217;t have to know Chinese. We are a group of our own where
                                you get by with German. Actually, I should talk to Chinese people
                                more often, when I think about it. It is really strange how few
                                Chinese friends I have. That is, none.</italic>

                    <p>Antonia thinks that the extrinsic motivation to learn Chinese is, for some
                        students, very low because they can manage their daily lives successfully
                        without having any Chinese language skills. Antonia&#8217;s lack of Chinese
                        friends, on the other hand, cannot be attributed to an inability to
                        communicate. As she sees it, making friends with Chinese locals would
                        require more effort on her part. </p>
                    <p>Paul, though he does not know any Chinese, also believes that there is a

                    <p>Paul readily labels the barrier hindering him from having Chinese friends as
                        &#8220;the whole culture thing&#8221; but leaves his belief unexplained.
                        Norwegian student Britta&#8217;s description of her initial encounters with
                        a Chinese family touches upon this issue as well, showing how this cultural
                        barrier can be understood as consisting of unknown practices, for instance
                        eating habits.</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s116">
                            <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                            <p> I like it so much more when I have western friends, or like, I don't
                                know, like international friends. Then they can just take me [along]
                                and you don't have to figure out the stuff. [&#8230;] In the
                                beginning, we were with this Chinese family, and they just took us
                                to these really hardcore Chinese food places and we are like, how
                                can we eat this? We are not used to this. And can't even use
                                chopsticks. So I am, like, glad that I find similar things to home
                                then.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Britta apparently experiences the need to &#8220;figure out the stuff&#8221;
                        in order to cross the local-expat divide as stressful, uncomfortable, and
                        perhaps even frightening. She thus actively seeks out the company of, in her
                        words, &#8220;international friends.&#8221; These statements illustrate that
                        the international high school students actively participate in the
                        boundary-drawing of the expatriate communities. However, Britta&#8217;s
                        quote also shows that the demarcation gives expatriate teenagers, who
                        constantly move, a sense of continuity through finding &#8220;similar things
                        to home.&#8221; The tentative exploration of Shanghai&#8217;s environment,
                        coping with the emotional strain of moving, and integration into the
                        expatriate community are among the many experiences expatriate teenagers are
                        forced to contend with (See Parts II and III.)</p>
                    <p>Sixteen-year-old Charlie, whose parents grew up in China, says that having a
                        different daily routine is another explanation for her difficulty making
                        Chinese friends:</p>

                                But it is difficult. I can&#8217;t speak from my own experience, but
                                my friend [who is the child of Chinese parents, born in Germany, at
                                the German school], for instance, has Chinese friends. And she also
                                notes every time, that there is a difference. And that they mostly
                                have no time because of school. Because they always have to study.
                                And that they think differently. It&#8217;s a little
                                different.</italic>

                    <p>Charlie thinks that the separation of international and Chinese schools and
                        the extremely time-consuming Chinese schooling renders friendships to local
                        Chinese students difficult for her. Based on her friend&#8217;s accounts,
                        she also assumes that they &#8220;think differently.&#8221; </p>
                    <p>While the statements above, which I related to the four barriers stemming
                        from Karina&#8217;s interpretation of &#8220;integration,&#8221; mostly
                        revolve around differences, some students also reflect upon the lack of
                        opportunities&#8212;and effort made&#8212;to get to know Chinese youths. </p>

                            <p><italic> But I had a Chinese friend. The daughter of my mom&#8217;s
                                friend. We were always close friends. And then, in fifth or sixth
                                grade, her school got really tough. And then we couldn&#8217;t see
                                each other anymore. And since then we are hardly in touch anymore.
                                That is a little difficult with the people here, because they have
                                so much school. But still, when we go out for example, I like to
                                talk to the Chinese. They are mostly university students, because
                                then they have time to party. And then I feel accepted. But I still
                                feel like a foreigner at the same time. Because they see me as a

                    <p>Antonia&#8217;s statement again reveals the differences in school systems as
                        a key factor in impeding friendships with &#8220;local&#8221; students. She
                        also points out that, the older students are, the greater this divide
                        becomes. My own observations confirm that (especially for teenagers) there
                        is very little overlap in the everyday spaces of expatriate and Chinese
                        youths. Additionally, even those spaces that are less
                        demarcated&#8212;namely, nightlife spaces (Part IV, Chapter 2) and the shop
                        (Part IV, Chapter 3)&#8212;present few possibilities for meeting Chinese
                        students their age. </p>
                    <p>In addition to drawing (spatial) barriers to create comfort zones, language
                        difficulties, differences in practices surrounding food and education, and
                        the lack of places to meet Chinese youths, some expatriate teenagers also
                        perceive the Chinese state and its citizens as active agents in keeping
                        foreigners &#8220;foreign.&#8221;</p>

                        foreigners</title>
                    <p>Some students also voiced a feeling that China, or Shanghai&#8217;s citizens,
                        reject or limit non-Chinese people from being part of their society. In this
                        section, and keeping the expatriates&#8217; practices of demarcation in
                        mind, I present three teenage girls&#8217; perceptions of exclusion. Two
                        perspectives, those of white girls Andrea and Karina, convey their feelings
                        on the local-expat divide, as well as the state&#8217;s policies and its
                        treatment of foreigners. The third perspective is that of Antonia, whose
                        parents are German and Chinese. She reflects on her status in Chinese
                        society and describes how Chinese people constantly ascribe the status of
                        &#8220;foreigner&#8221; to her. It shows that her idea of urban citizenship,
                        her claim to be Shanghainese as a way of taking a transcultural perspective
                        (as I discussed in Part I, Chapter 4.1) can be difficult to pursue. </p>

                            <p> On an emotional level, I&#8217;d say that we are not really, well,
                                we are not a part of it. [&#8230;] The Chinese also call us
                                foreigners. That&#8217;s what we are. I don&#8217;t think we will
                                ever, I don&#8217;t know. Well, I don&#8217;t have the feeling that
                                they allow us in entirely. We have our special [status], we are
                                treated differently. I notice.  <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2099">60</xref></p>

                    <p>While Andrea&#8217;s assumption is not entirely true, research by Anna
                        Greenspan (Greenspan 2008a; 2008b; 2011b; 2011a) demonstrates the extreme
                        difficulties expatriates face when choosing local schools. Greenspan&#8217;s
                        research comments on the differences between Chinese and
                        &#8220;Western&#8221; education, a debate that gained prominence not only in
                        the USA, but also in Germany, after the publication of Amy Chua&#8217;s
                        Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother (<xref rid="IDdeda2eca-4ccd-44b9-9ebb-79ddfedb189b" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1edff385-5941-4a01-b138-c40287bcebf8">2011</xref>). In her blogs
                        and writings, Greenspan discusses cases of western families who chose the
                        Chinese education system for their children. Investigating parents&#8217;
                        and children&#8217;s challenges in adjusting to the different school system,
                        Greenspan shows that enrollment at local schools in Shanghai is possible,
                        but only if parents and children possess the necessary language skills and
                        persistence. One mother interviewed by Greenspan describes the difficulties
                        her family experienced when attempting to enroll her children in a Chinese

                    <p>The extraordinary efforts foreigners have to make to send their children to a

                        a joint talk with James Farrer at a workshop organized by Heidelberg
                        University&#8217;s Cluster of Excellence: &#8220;Asia and Europe in a Global

                        <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2157">65</xref> Greenspan discussed the cases
                        of a few parents and children who chose this option. She found that teachers
                        continuously ascribed &#8220;foreign&#8221; status to foreign children, i.e.
                        using them to shame other students who performed worse in class than the
                        foreigners did. Many western parents, Greenspan argued, also felt uneasy
                        about the political education their children received, which conflicted too
                        strongly with their own values.</p>

                                something, discussed it, and then jumped on him and told him
                                &#8220;It is your fault.&#8221; And then, of course, the police were

                    <p>While other students feel that Chinese law does not apply to them&#8212;as we

                        Experiences, therefore, differ greatly. Karina&#8217;s family is originally
                        from the Czech Republic, where her relatives experienced the Prague Spring,
                        in 1968. Her family&#8217;s memories of this era, which they likely
                        communicated to Karina, undoubtedly contribute to her fear of arbitrary
                        state power and her perception of the Chinese state as being hostile toward

                                the next generation, and so on. And then they should integrate
                                themselves. Start speaking German and so on. But here, the

                                fragile possibility of urban citizenship. Reduced to their
                                sociological content these stories are symbolic claims to urban
                                citizenship: a claim of cultural citizenship (as &#8220;Old Shanghai
                                hands&#8221; or &#8220;New Shanghailanders&#8221;), a claim of
                                social citizenship (as witness to history and local residents), and
                                a claim of economic citizenship (as &#8220;players&#8221; in
                                Shanghai&#8217;s global economy). Woven altogether&#8212;as they
                                sometimes are&#8212;they form an ideal of a culturally cosmopolitan,
                                locally integrated and economically contributing global/urban
                                citizen, conveniently eliding the nation-state. Few settlers
                                actually live up to this nearly impossible ideal, and thus these
                                narratives of emplacement often serve as claims to relative virtue
                                or entitlement in comparisons with other &#8220;foreigners.&#8221;

                    <p>Like Farrer&#8217;s informants&#8217; &#8220;claims to relative virtue or
                        entitlement,&#8221; Antonia&#8217;s claims to being Shanghainese should be
                        seen as distinct among her expatriate classmates. At the same time, Antonia,
                        like Farrer&#8217;s informants, has a high ideal of being a
                        &#8220;culturally cosmopolitan, locally integrated&#8221; citizen.
                        Antonia&#8217;s reflections show how it is difficult to &#8220;live up to
                        this nearly impossible ideal.&#8221; As the child of a mixed marriage who
                        even speaks Chinese, she describes how she still feels she will never fit
                        in. </p>

                    <p>She further explains how Chinese society&#8217;s refusal to accept her as
                        Shanghainese leads her to doubt her Shanghainese identity and claims to
                        &#8220;Chineseness.&#8221; To be regarded as &#8220;Shanghainese,&#8221;
                        however, is also an impossible status for migrants from other parts of
                        China, as briefly discussed at the beginning of this chapter. Consequently,
                        while Antonia would otherwise consider herself Shanghainese, she feels like
                        a foreigner because she believes she is seen as one. I have elaborated on
                        her identity performances in Part I, but her descriptions are also
                        interesting in the context of Shanghainese-expat relations. She notes:</p>

                    <title>4.5. Concluding thoughts on the local-expat youth divide in Shanghai </title>
                    <p>When aiming to be part of Shanghai&#8217;s cosmopolitan image, expatriate
                        teenagers often turn to the city&#8217;s spaces that are frequented by both
                        foreigners and locals, as Chapter 2 of this part (on nightlife) illustrates.
                        Further, the young expatriates explore and claim open spaces outside the
                        traditional, glamorous image of the metropolis&#8212;such as the
                        shop&#8212;to simply hang out with their friends. Their engagement with the
                        city through such places serves an important function by helping them find a
                        sense of emplacement, and to regain the agency they might have been missing
                        after moving, which is always initiated by their parents. In order to foster
                        a sense of continuity, community, and social standing, and to create
                        comfortable ways of life (see Part III), however, the expatriates draw
                        boundaries between themselves and Shanghai&#8217;s &#8220;locals.&#8221; The
                        experience of emplacement and locality is thus, at the same time, tied to
                        expatriate practices that attempt, to a certain extent, to exclude
                        &#8220;China&#8221; from their everyday spaces&#8212;for example at the
                        international schools, gated communities, Western restaurants, and imported
                        food stores that expatriates frequent.</p>
                    <p>Focusing on the &#8220;diaspora space,&#8221; a &#8220;point at which
                        boundaries of inclusion and exclusion, of belonging and otherness, of
                        &#8216;us&#8217; and &#8216;them&#8217;, are contested&#8221; (<xref rid="IDe6ebb9fc-dfad-415d-b6ff-0e7304deeb71" ref-type="bibr" id="ID85fd8ae1-3948-493e-ad9c-c912c3df504b">Brah 1996,
                            208&#8211;209</xref>) and by discussing students&#8217; ideas about
                        &#8220;integration&#8221; in Shanghai, this chapter shows that transgressing
                        or even dissolving the strong local-expat divide is generally difficult for
                        expatriate teenagers. None of the students I accompanied during their
                        everyday routines have local friends. These youths often see their
                        expatriate community as self-sufficient or even &#8220;autonomous.&#8221;
                        Students feel that interacting with or even befriending Chinese people is
                        difficult because they are considered different for being white. Most
                        students gain this awareness of bodily differences, of being consciously
                        white, suddenly and unprepared and they experience it as unsettling. As a
                        consequence, they often seek out places with large numbers of other white
                        people. The teenagers are also intimidated by language and cultural
                        barriers. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, expatriate youths who were in frequent contact with Chinese
                        children when they were younger experience Chinese teenagers as being too
                        involved with their schoolwork and having no time for friendships or
                        activities outside of school. Therefore, neither the Chinese and expat
                        students&#8217; schools nor their leisure spaces coincide. The strong
                        local-expat divide is therefore also related to a lack of concrete meeting
                        places, a lack which is interpreted by some students as the Chinese
                        government&#8217;s way of keeping Chinese and foreign youths apart. Chinese
                        passport holders are prohibited by the Shanghai municipal government from
                        enrolling in international schools, and Chinese local schools are not an
                        option&#8212;or at least a very difficult one&#8212;for foreign students, as
                        the accounts by Greenspan (<xref rid="ID35b7ad63-35f2-4d90-8746-d06aacd886f5" ref-type="bibr" id="ID67d4f467-efda-4d69-8a06-3ddbeaac6f9c">2008a</xref>; <xref rid="IDa0c4c0ab-99dd-4a5e-9a66-4240ea1cb212" ref-type="bibr" id="ID6005bb2c-0984-42be-9150-055e8de4a968">2008b</xref>; <xref rid="IDf97e7077-99a6-4752-b49f-e9acb2b7d6ca" ref-type="bibr" id="IDed5abe79-d8f5-4b1c-bd9b-bc2470d6fd73">2011b</xref>; <xref rid="ID417380bb-6483-4192-bdf7-5cc45a2cb1d2" ref-type="bibr" id="IDc64b9b51-5261-4b57-a4dd-737f0fd74d02">2011a</xref>) above show.
                        Expatriate teenagers consequently perceive the Chinese state as either
                        intimidating or as not pertinent to them, emphasizing their different, even
                        &#8220;special&#8221; status as foreign passport holders. Furthermore, the
                        expatriate teenagers that attempt to cross such perceptions and borders feel
                        that the Chinese youths regard them as &#8220;exotic&#8221; and that Chinese
                        society only accepts them as &#8220;guests.&#8221; </p>
                    <p>This lack of interaction with Chinese youths demonstrates that the most
                        influential part of the move to Shanghai, for some students, might not
                        necessarily be exploring or learning about the new cultural environment or
                        specific cultural practices in Shanghai, but rather their general experience
                        of &#8220;difference&#8221; and the emotional challenges associated with
                        being uprooted. In the words of ethnographer Ghassan Hage (<xref rid="ID18a9d278-f726-4659-b7e3-1da223092356" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3a838495-46ac-4147-beb5-8cefd322047c">2005</xref>), who studied
                        Lebanese communities in different national settings, &#8220;one should also
                        be careful not to think that just because we feel we are crossing
                        international borders, the change from one national culture to another is
                        the most signi&#64257;cant aspect of our move&#8221; (Hage <xref rid="ID18a9d278-f726-4659-b7e3-1da223092356" ref-type="bibr" id="ID047d8331-b6fb-414e-8531-b2b887d4d58d">2005</xref>, 470).</p>
                    <p>Hage&#8217;s words bring us back to the idea of transcultural perspectives
                        that I described in the Introduction, to the students&#8217; own reflections
                        on the various aspects and consequences of moving abroad. As described in
                        Part I, Chapter 4, when tracing four students&#8217; different transcultural
                        perspectives and identity positionings, this chapter shows in more detail
                        how the experience of difference and attempts to overcome (as well as
                        efforts to draw and maintain) boundaries are central to expatriate
                        students&#8217; daily lives. The distinctions expatriate youths make towards
                        &#8220;local&#8221; society and the apparent lack of opportunity to meet (as
                        well as their meager interest in meeting) Shanghainese youths, originate in
                        the transitory nature of their stay in Shanghai&#8212;an aspect of the
                        expatriate lifestyle that is highlighted throughout this ethnography. The
                        international students are all aware that the moment of moving on will come.
                        For the youths I worked with at the German school, this moment coincides
                        with graduation, an event that I discuss in all its elements of celebration
                        and farewell&#8212;and the corresponding need to make decisions about the
                        future that it places on all students&#8212;in the final part of this
                        ethnography, &#8220;Moving On.&#8221;</p>

Aber hier reicht&#8217;s schon wenn zwei Leute dich sehen, die nicht eingeweiht sind, dass du das &#246;fters machst und dann geht das in der Schule rum. Weil wir so eine kleine Community sind.</p>

                        von amerikanischen Schulen inspirieren lassen. Die ja immer sehr auf ihre
                        Gemeinschaft und so, und auf ihr Schulleben anspielen, gerne auch &#8211;
                        wie so Werbeaktionen praktisch. Das ist ja voll peinlich zum Teil. Ich hab
                        mir dann gedacht, das k&#228;me an unserer Schule sehr gut [...] an. Also es
                        war ja dann [so], also bei den Lehrern und so. Also ich bin dann so
                        vorgegangen, okay, jetzt mach ich mal &#8216;nen Projekt, muss ja jetzt
                        nicht, weil ich kann nicht so gut fotografieren [&#8230;], muss ja jetzt
                        nicht fotografisch &#252;berzeugen. Aber es kann ja mal so ein bisschen
                        anspielen, dass wir eine Schule sind, &#8220;geborgen und gemeinsam
                        gewachsen&#8221; [Anspielung an Schulslogan] und so was. Weil das ja nicht
                        so deutsch ist so was, sich da so selbst zu pr&#228;sentieren [&#8230;]
                        dachte ich mir auch, dass das entsprechend von meinen Lehrern aufgegriffen
                        werden k&#246;nnte. Und ehm &lt;L&gt;, war ja schon sehr cheesy alles. Und
                        hab dann im Internet gegoogelt, was es denn so f&#252;r Zitate gibt, denn
                        ich wollte gern so was mit Text und Fotografie machen. Und ja dann kam da
                        &#8220;My time is now,&#8221; was ja voll perfekt ist. Und so ein bisschen
                        sehr kitschig. Und hab dann halt dieses T-Shirt [gemacht], ich dachte mir:
                        &#8220;Ja, okay, dann k&#246;nnen die das tragen oder halten.&#8221; [...].
                        Und dieses Schild. Und dann bin ich in der Schule rum und hab ein paar
                        Sch&#252;ler gefragt ob die mir da helfen. Dann hab ich meine Freundinnen
                        gefragt ob die mir da helfen, weil ich bin da nicht gerne so: &#8220;Hallo,
                        meine Name ist Andrea! Wir machen &lt;x&gt;.&#8221; Hab dann nat&#252;rlich,
                        ehm, mir M&#252;he gegeben ein paar Franzosen reinzubekommen, weil das
                        spielt ja noch mehr diese soziale Integration an. Die bei uns ja in

                <p> Valentine (2003) considers these self-made rituals and the perspective of youths
                    themselves as central for scholars who want to understand the transitional
                    process into adulthood: &#8220;In this sense perhaps rather than applying adult
                    measures of the extent to which children have achieved &#8216;adulthood&#8217;
                    we need to pay more attention to the different ways young people themselves
                    define and understand this boundary crossing. As such we also need to question
                    to what extent social categories such as gender, race, class and sexuality
                    actually have any meaning for young people as they grow up&#8221; (Valentine

                    clear sense of belonging to a specific group becomes especially important. Even
                    if reflections about belonging remain important as people grow older, the
                    emphasis on affiliations to particular peer groups and the need to be recognised

                <p>For a positive reading of such cross-ethnic sexual contacts, see cultural
                    historian Mica Nava&#8217;s reading of British women&#8217;s attraction to
                    foreign men in the early 20th century. Focusing on commercial culture because of
                    its responsiveness to the preferences of female customers, Nava demonstrates
                    British women&#8217;s interest in foreign culture, men, and cosmopolitanism.
                    &#8220;Unlike the exoticizing narratives identified by critics of
                    orientalism&#8212;in which &#8216;other&#8217; women are cast as objects of
                    sexual desire and the oriental landscape is represented rhetorically as erotic
                    female&#8212;in the cosmopolitanism of the commercial and entertainment spheres,
                    women appropriate the narratives of difference for themselves in contrary and
                    even polemical ways&#8220; . Nava convincingly argues that these women&#8217;s
                    &#8220;flirtation with difference, with the outside, the elsewhere, the
                    other&#8221; (ibid., 94) underlies an identification with the black male&#8217;s
                    position vis-&#224;-vis the dominant white man. Her emphasis on the production
                    of everyday cosmopolitanism, rather than racism, in the first decades of the
                    20th century, &#8220;however politically imperative&#8221; (ibid., 85),
                    demonstrates the complexity and the relevance of gender-specific experiences and
                    practices of vernacular cosmopolitanism.</p>

                    (2007) article &#8220;Partying as Everyday Life: Investigations of
                    Teenagers&#8217; Leisure Life,&#8221; which explores the meaning behind such
                    practices among Danish youths. By conceptualizing partying and alcohol
                    consumption as a rite of passage on the one hand, but situating these events in
                    everyday life on the other, their analysis suggests that, at such house parties,
                    the collective consumption of alcohol is a means to transform the parents&#8217;
                    living room into an appropriate space for partying. Using both qualitative and
                    quantitative material, the authors demonstrate that drinking alcohol
                    collectively does not only mean experimenting with intoxication, but
                    &#8220;symbolises commitment to both the party and to the specific group of
                    friends&#8221; (ibid., 517). Like the nightlife activities of the teenage
                    subjects in this study, partying at home is, for Danish youths, also a way of
                    reaffirming friendships. Therefore, Demant and &#216;stergaard argue that
                    partying is an integral part the everyday lives of adolescents. It helps them to
                    extend their networks of friends, as well as to continuously reaffirm existing
                    mutual attachments.</p>

                <p>(2005), in writing about experiences of (re)migration of expatriate youths from
                    Africa to Germany, reflects upon the effects that the experience of whiteness
                    can have for children. She describes the link between whiteness and superiority
                    as follows:</p>
                <p>The message the majority of white children growing up in "black" Africa get is
                    that being white goes along with being rich and superior. While blacks may also
                    (be)come rich and advance economically for different reasons, being rich appears
                    to be an innate and natural feature of being white, a feature of social class,
                    which in most cases goes along with a feeling of cultural superiority. Whereas
                    white parents in most cases have experienced that being white does not have such
                    implications everywhere, many white children lack this experience
                    altogether&#8212;and many of their parents prefer forgetting it while in Africa

                        mich immer wie so ein exotisches Tier.</italic>

Wirklich f&#252;nf Mal in der Woche in der Mittagspause schnell r&#252;ber. Hab mir da was zu essen gekauft, zum Beispiel das </italic>gongbao<italic> oder so. Das ist unglaublich lecker und eigentlich auch ziemlich billig. Daf&#252;r aber eine riesige Portion. Die kochen das wirklich gut. Obwohl, wenn man sich so die Umgebung anschaut, so ziemlich heruntergekommen, da denkt man sich so, von der Hygiene her will ich da lieber nichts essen. Aber das ist wirklich gut. Und ja, in dem Shop, da sind meistens immer Sch&#252;ler, die sich was zu trinken kaufen. Irgendwelche Br&#246;tchen, S&#252;&#223;igkeiten, Kaugummis, alles M&#246;gliche. Das ist unsere Versorgung da.</italic>
