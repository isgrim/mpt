      <title>Part III: Arriving</title>
      <p>This mental map depicting high-rise buildings, a large, elevated highway, and masses of
        people, was drawn by a girl at an international Singaporean school and illustrates how
        impressive and overwhelming arriving and living in Shanghai can be. The sixteen-year-old
        student annotated her map with the following caption:</p>
      <p>The city, Shanghai, is continuously developing. Every day when I&#8217;m on the bus,
        looking outside the window, I can always find new infrastructures. The buildings are HUGE
        and the road is crowded. The map is what I see every day on the bus. It&#8217;s a busy
        Shanghai and is changing every day. People walk swiftly just like they are trying to catch
        up the beat of Shanghai.</p>
      <p>In my view, her drawing and annotation illustrate not only the unfamiliar urban
        environment, but also the radical changes, losses, and new encounters that teenagers face
        when moving to their new city of residence. It is the students&#8217; ways of
        &#8220;catching up with the beat of Shanghai&#8221; and their new situation that this part
        of the book aims to examine. The following three chapters discuss how youths manage these
        difficulties and their new environment by outlining three important processes: exploring the
        city, establishing home-making practices, and building communities. </p>
      <p>The ethnographic material I present supports Fechter&#8217;s (2007b) observations of the
        importance of boundaries in expatriates&#8217; lives and underpins her argument that their
        &#8220;insistence on fortifying spatial and social divides challenges notions of a
        transnational capitalist class which is claimed to be geographically mobile and cosmopolitan
        in outlook (Sklair [<xref id="IDbbe668ea-8a92-4946-9568-6449ac554823" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDa3f1963d-1874-4413-890b-7b4f7abb7cd3">2001</xref>] 2003; Hannerz [<xref id="ID62a72ccc-be36-48af-8fab-cdf5b5b59a0d" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID74b75761-ef81-4f91-be18-136f0ae2adc1">1996</xref>] <xref id="IDa8eb1883-0905-4693-b21d-7608aa963f6a" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID74b75761-ef81-4f91-be18-136f0ae2adc1">2001</xref>) [&#8230;] such conceptions
        appear to be insufficiently grounded in ethnographic realities&#8221; (ibid.,
        80&#8211;81).</p>
      <p>Similar to Fechter&#8217;s findings, these chapters illustrate how, in the context of their
        mobile lifestyles, expatriate youths draw boundaries upon their arrival in Shanghai. Chapter
        1 argues that expatriate youths&#8217; practices of managing the city are based on dividing
        it into expat and non-expat places. Chapter 2 demonstrates that their home-making practices
        are centered on both the fortified housing complexes where they live (and which separate
        their inhabitants from the outside world) and on staying connected with their family,
        friends, and former places of residence. Chapter 3 shows that the shared space of school is
        crucial for community-building processes and the friendships international students form.
        However, these community spaces also foster the performances of a collective expatriate
        identity in Shanghai with distinct values and practices that also enable the actor to
        distinguish him or herself from &#8220;locals&#8221; or those back &#8220;home.&#8221; </p>
      <p>Focusing on the subjective experiences children and teenagers face when moving, the
        everyday spatial and social practices presented in this part are regarded as complex
        emotional work (Hochschild [<xref id="ID07a4fde5-5512-4041-9123-4641bc9b8f0c" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID42604018-a112-4090-9df4-6704ba421479">1983</xref>] 2003). This
        emotional work means coping with the moving experience through creating meaningful everyday
        social spaces&#8212;places of pleasure and consumption in the city, a space where a notion
        of home can unfold, a feeling of belonging to a school and/or expatriate community. Friends
        and various media&#8212;German online newspapers, social media such as Facebook, and
        communication technology like Skype&#8212;as well as family, food, material culture, and
        explorations of the new environment help the students deal with the move and develop ways to
        adjust to their new situation.</p>

        <title>Chapter 1: Making Sense of the City</title>
        <p>Bjorn: <italic>The most difficult challenge was just this culture shock. To take a taxi
            somewhere. To use the subway, I&#8217;d never done that.</italic>
          <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e66">1</xref>
        </p>
        <p>A common way of gradually discovering Shanghai is experiencing the city on trips or
          through activities with family or friends. Learning to navigate Shanghai&#8217;s urban
          environment, as sixteen-year-old, self-confessed &#8220;villager&#8221; Bjorn&#8217;s
          comment suggests, is a crucial way of coming to terms with the stay abroad.</p>
        <p>The metropolis Shanghai has evoked and still evokes diverse images and its recent
          high-speed development startles every visitor. Donald and Gammack (<xref id="ID74232d98-13e0-4284-a234-6c60bef28cc7" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc262e284-335b-41f5-a521-3e4ec891c4f2">2007</xref>) describe Shanghai&#8217;s
          growth in Tourism and the Branded City: Film and Identity on the Pacific Rim, capturing
          the amazement it often generates:</p>
        <p>Infrastructure development in connection with Expo is unprecedented, and is positioning
          Shanghai for world competitiveness in several areas. A second airport, a new satellite
          city built on mud flats, a dock for cruise liners and Lupu Bridge, the world's longest
          arch bridge are some significant recent projects. The superfast Maglev train from the
          airport gives international arrivals an immediate sense of Shanghai's speed, while ongoing
          urban-rail development will see the six or seven lines that were in place in 2006 more
          than doubled by 20<xref id="ID36ae20da-3565-4904-a42c-9724b00701e8" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID82f22d04-1040-4d30-b0cc-17724d43d18f">Chen 2005</xref>), and the total length of
          rail-track laid at present increase almost fourfold. The metro systems of London and Tokyo
          are two world-city benchmarks which Shanghai is seeking to exceed (<xref id="ID508e831f-efc5-4163-a50c-1ce6fedaa0cf" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc262e284-335b-41f5-a521-3e4ec891c4f2">Donald and Gammack 2007, 151</xref>).12
          (</p>
        <p>Donald and Gammack&#8217;s account of infrastructure projects in Shanghai links the city
          to the idea of speed, which is reminiscent of the &#8220;beat of Shanghai&#8221; that the
          Singaporean student described when annotating her mental map (Figure 4). When I started
          researching foreign youth in Shanghai, the projects described by Donald and Gammack in
          2007 had all been completed and the city was in the middle of hosting the 20<xref id="ID96723b35-1ff7-49c8-afbf-81b389d40820" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc262e284-335b-41f5-a521-3e4ec891c4f2">Donald and Gammack 2007, 154</xref>). 10
          Expo. This mega-event had given &#8220;both a deadline and a unifying purpose to the
          city's debut preparations [&#8230;] on a far grander scale than the construction of new
          stadia and exhibition halls typical of what other cities might produce. The entire city
          [was] being reconstructed&#8212;literally and metaphorically&#8221; (</p>
        <p>Sometimes overwhelmed by the speed and contrasts of this rapidly developing mega-city, so
          fittingly exemplified by the 2010 Expo, I wondered how the teenagers made sense of
          Shanghai. By examining how the students explore their new urban environment, I show that
          both learning to navigate Shanghai and the city&#8217;s inherent sensorial impressions
          help the students manage their environment, by giving spaces a social meaning, they divide
          the city into manageable categories of what is &#8220;familiar&#8221; and
          &#8220;unfamiliar.&#8221;</p>
        <p>After the move to Shanghai, newcomers have to learn how to navigate the city. While buses
          hired by the schools provide transport to campus, students have to organize their
          transport to other destinations on their own. For my part, I depended largely on
          Shanghai&#8217;s continuously expanding network of subway lines, referred to locally as
          the &#8220;metro.&#8221; The subway provides a convenient mode of transportation, but
          closes at eleven p.m.&#8212;early for a city of its size. The teenage students, however,
          do not use the metro very often. </p>
        <p>This avoidance of the subway system is mainly due to the readily available school buses
          and taxis. With fares starting at RMB 12 (&#8364;1.32), or RMB 14 (&#8364;1.54) after the
          summer of 2011, taxis are relatively inexpensive for an expatriate family income. Another
          preferred method of travel is the parents&#8217; private car and driver, which are
          sometimes provided as a job benefit for senior-level expatriate employees. Both means of
          transportation are comfortable, but not without challenges. The following discussion on
          navigating through the city, recorded between three fourteen-year-old students, Keith, a
          boy from Singapore, Freda, a girl from Norway, and Vijay, a boy from India, shows that
          taking the taxi or the private car requires students to find ways to interact with local
          drivers, who usually do not speak English.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This discussion illustrates that students can either rely on transportation provided by
          the school or the parents or find their own ways of moving through the city, for example
          by using text messaging services to communicate with taxi drivers. Despite these language
          barriers, the students still consider taxis easier to use than the metro. Some students
          own motor scooters, but use them predominantly in the direct vicinity of their housing
          areas. German school student Peter, for instance, owns a motor scooter, but soon gave it
          up as a means of daily transportation from the downtown apartment to school. When I asked
          him about it, he told me he had driven it three times to school, twice having minor
          accidents, one of which could have seriously harmed him, had he not been wearing his
          helmet. Driving oneself is therefore usually considered too dangerous. </p>
        <p>To further understand the expatriate youths movements through and relation to the city, I
          asked thirteen students at a local German school, three students at a British school, and
          seventeen students at a Singaporean school to record on paper their mental maps of
          everyday, important places in Shanghai. The results show that their visualizations follow
          a common pattern. The following table lists the places that were referred to most often

        <p>The mental maps are clustered around important places such as school, home, and
          friends&#8217; homes, and leisure spaces such as caf&#233;s, restaurants, or bars and
          clubs. Furthermore, iconic landmarks found their way onto the maps, probably to set the
          scene and mark the city on the map as Shanghai. Additionally, these city icons&#8212;such
          as the Oriental Pearl Tower or the Bottle Opener<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e479">2</xref>&#8212;may also be included in many of the drawings because they offer a point
          of entry to explore the city, or to identify with living in Shanghai. Eleven-year-old
          Allen, for instance, developed a fascination for Shanghai&#8217;s skyline. When asked if
          he has a favorite place in Shanghai, he replies with pride and enthusiasm: </p>

          <speech id="s15">
            <speaker>Allen</speaker>
            <p>The bottle opener. I have been up on the 91st floor in it and I had dinner up there,

        <p>These mental maps provide insights into teenagers&#8217; preferred spaces, forms of
          transport, and activities, as the following example, drawn by sixteen-year-old Olivia, a
          member of &#8220;the girls,&#8221; demonstrates (Figure 5).</p>
        <p>Olivia&#8217;s map shows urban icons, such as the Oriental Pearl tower, and popular
          landmarks such as the Bund, the Yu-Garden, and the People&#8217;s Square. Concerning
          movement through and out of Shanghai, the drawing refers to metro stations (marked with a
          circled M), a car (in reference to a friend who lives outside the city), and the two city
          airports. The map presents the city as a space for satisfying individual needs. It
          revolves around places of consumption such as the Superbrand Mall, Plaza 66, the Fake
          Market, the shopping street Qipulu, and Pearl City. Furthermore, the student even includes
          specific brand stores such as Zara, H&amp;M, Mango, and Roxy on her map. While shopping
          here could be a family activity, the teenagers (and the girls in particular) enjoy going
          shopping with friends. Miller et al. (<xref id="ID609154dc-d187-4842-b17d-4c8173149366" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID3c65f11f-610d-429a-bc8d-f6d927347fe6">1998, 101</xref>) suggest
          that teenagers not only visit such commercial spaces for consumption, but to express their
          &#8220;growing independence from their parents.&#8221; The school, friends&#8217; houses
          (anonymized by the author), and Olivia&#8217;s own home are also seen as integral parts of
          the city. Restaurants, bars, and clubs form another large proportion. The student even
          names the clubs&#8212;Mural, M2 (Muse 2), Paramount, and Park 97&#8212;in an explanatory
          cloud. Her visual representation of the city, this fixing of her spatial practices,
          provides insights not only into her everyday life, but also into her image of the city,
          her aspirations about it, and what might be considered the stage for her own identity
          performances. Chapter 2 of Part IV will further elaborate on these reciprocal relations of
          age identity and spaces when examining students&#8217; nightlife practices.</p>
        <p>While the importance of visual impressions is immediately apparent in these student maps,
          considering the exact shapes of certain buildings such as the school, shopping malls, or
          urban landmarks, other sensorial impressions of the city are underrepresented. The next
          subchapter aims to explore the role other sensory experiences such as sounds, smells, and
          tastes play when exploring the new urban environment and making sense of Shanghai.</p>

          <title>1.2. Sensing the city</title>
          <p>When I tried to do what I had asked of so many students&#8212;to draw a map of all the
            places in Shanghai that I considered personally significant&#8212;I suddenly became
            aware of the skill with which some of the students were able to record their visual
            impressions on paper; I myself was unsure of how to draw certain details. Sensories are
            personal, not only in their interpretation but also in their use. When I started to
            write down city sounds, for example, much more came to mind: the metro beeping before
            closing its doors, the sound of the honking but otherwise silent electric scooters
            rushing by, the jingle playing when 7-<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e510">3</xref> the
            spoken words on the streets that I tried to untangle and sort into Shanghainese (the
            local dialect, understandable only to Shanghai natives, it seems) and Mandarin (the
            official, common language of the country). When waking up in the dark, these sounds
            would tell me whether it was already morning or still the middle of the night. I
            constantly made sense of my environment through sounds. And when the city&#8217;s voice
            became too exhausting, I put on my headphones, just like the students, to try to achieve
            some distance from it. Sometimes the common use of portable music players led to
            conversations about music. Bjorn, for instance, often introduced me to the bands he was
            listening to. The students and I talked about music but, unless it was about a concert
            in town (German DJ Paul Kalkbrenner, for example), or about choosing a certain nightlife
            space, we did not tie music and city sounds (or the blocking out of city sounds)
            together; the discussion rather served to stage certain subcultural preferences. Sounds
            are a vibrant part of the city experience and future inquiries into the Shanghai
            soundscapes are worthy of exploration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e514">4</xref> While
            sounds seemed central to my own navigation and understanding of the city, taste was the
            sense that featured predominantly in all of the students&#8217; mental maps of
            Shanghai.1 1 doors glide open, the unpleasant noises of Shanghai&#8217;s innumerable
            construction sites, the shouting of the used electric appliance dealers
            (&#8220;kongtiao, diannao&#8221;),</p>
          <p>Hongmei Road, for instance, the vertically-running street on the left of Olivia&#8217;s
            map (Figure 5), is a small lane in the western part of Shanghai and popular among
            expatriates for its variety of foreign restaurants. The importance of places to eat in
            their expatriate life is visible on most of the students&#8217; maps. The prominence
            given to foreign food, restaurants, and leisure spaces in their city maps shows that,
            for these students, taste and navigation in the city are linked. Scholars like David
            Howes (<xref id="ID0bcd064b-0469-4e27-9b4e-4c7b44c970e8" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4645345a-7926-4542-9e53-cf9d4fb9e986">2007</xref>) have pointed out the
            importance of all senses in making &#8220;sense&#8221; of both our environment and
            ourselves.</p>
          <p>Sensation is not just a matter of physiological response and personal experience. It is
            the most fundamental domain of cultural expression, the medium through which all the
            values and practices of society are enacted. To a greater or lesser extent, every domain
            of sensory experience, from the sight of a work of art to the scent of perfume to the
            savor of dinner, is a field of cultural elaboration. Every domain of sensory experience
            is also an arena for structuring social roles and interactions. We learn social
            divisions, distinctions of gender, class and race, through our senses. [&#8230;] Sensual
            relations are also social relations (<xref id="ID060135b4-0754-4b39-8268-4de0045c94c7" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID4645345a-7926-4542-9e53-cf9d4fb9e986">Howes 2007,
            xi</xref>).</p>
          <p>Howes&#8217;s anthropological investigations explore how sensory experience can be
            structured and invested with meaning in many different ways across cultures. While this
            anthropological endeavor to study, compare, and theorize the cultural formation of the
            senses is fascinating, my own interest lies in how important senses are to exploring and
            experiencing urban spaces. There is obviously a difference between being in a place that
            we are able to experience at the same time with all our senses, and the virtual,
            imaginary places that are also present in our lives. Howes ([<xref id="ID1585c75e-6568-43af-9af1-663644f66867" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7a524c42-8dca-4b8e-ae01-3a4bd1ec8915">2005</xref>] 2006, 7) calls this
            &#8220;sensuous interrelationship of body-mind-environment&#8221;
            &#8220;emplacement.&#8221; Walmsley (<xref id="ID9b3d1137-ebf7-4501-a3f0-8ee30b59347d" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7a524c42-8dca-4b8e-ae01-3a4bd1ec8915">2005</xref>) applies
            Howes&#8217;s concept of emplacement to different situations in Ecuador, for example to
            a market site:</p>
          <p>An Ecuadorian market [&#8230;] draws attention to the role of intersensoriality in the
            production of meaning through everyday lived experiences. Smells, sights, tastes,
            textures and sounds signify each other according to the particular context and the
            particular sensory knowledge of the individual experiencing them. This points to a
            central theme in the study of culture and the senses, which is that of
            &#8216;emplacement&#8217; (<xref id="ID69fbf92f-4f33-4205-9841-f8328ef161b9" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7a524c42-8dca-4b8e-ae01-3a4bd1ec8915">Walmsley 2005,
            47</xref>).</p>
          <p>Walmsley uses the concept of emplacement to analyze the associations between place,
            identity, and sensory experience and to find out how racial categories in Ecuador are
            produced with all senses. Her ethnographic case in point shows how intersensorial
            experiences evoke feelings of both strangeness and belonging. These feelings play a
            fundamental part in processes of cultural (and in her case racial) identity negotiation.
            Tastes and smells are mostly discussed in terms of their relationship to food. As
            Walmsley (<xref id="ID5ae4288a-1cef-4b44-a9b7-6db6a23db714" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7a524c42-8dca-4b8e-ae01-3a4bd1ec8915">2005, 55</xref>) notes: &#8220;Sensory
            knowledge is developed through the sociality of food practices, which are produced
            through the sharing of tastes, smells and embodied culinary techniques.&#8221;</p>
          <p>In today&#8217;s Shanghai, the range of available tastes (as both sensory experience
            and culinary preference) is highly diverse. Shanghainese would constantly point this out
            to me by simply saying, &#8220;Shanghai dou you&#8221; (&#8220;Shanghai has
            everything&#8221;). With regard to cuisine, this may well be true. Shanghai contains
            German and French bakeries, Italian restaurants, American diners, numerous teppanyaki
            places, and all kinds of Chinese cuisine from spicy Sichuan dishes to northern Chinese
            noodles. International food stores carry almost everything the expatriate might miss
            (Figure 6). </p>
          <p>The students from the German school included their favorite Italian or American
            restaurants on their mental maps, while students from the Singaporean school in
            particular listed Korean or Japanese restaurants. Names of international chains like
            Starbucks are also included. Additionally, students embrace new tastes from non-Chinese
            sources, as a visit to a Japanese all-you-can-eat Sushi restaurant with a group of
            German students showed me. But as Walmsley (<xref id="IDc9858573-5485-47b4-b208-ada887772ff3" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7a524c42-8dca-4b8e-ae01-3a4bd1ec8915">2005, 55</xref>) already pointed out:
            &#8220;an individual&#8217;s sensory knowledge is never fixed or limited but always
            capable of adapting and expanding.&#8221; The senses, like these experiences in the
            foreign restaurants on the aforementioned Hongmei Road, connect the people in Shanghai
            with distant places. Walmsley also noted how this tendency applied to the stalls at the
            Ecuadorian market, which &#8220;also remind customers of other places, times, and
            people&#8221; (<xref id="IDb6299f60-dab0-4c35-a420-ac207365419a" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7a524c42-8dca-4b8e-ae01-3a4bd1ec8915">ibid., 47</xref>). Olfactory experiences
            and memories of places go hand-in-hand. Food and dining practices therefore play a role
            in the process of home-making, as I will explore further in Chapter 2. Some of these
            dining places turned into spaces for regular gatherings that, over time, came to hold
            special meaning for those involved. &#8220;The girls,&#8221; for instance, frequently
            met at an Indian Restaurant on Hongmei Road. &#8220;The boys&#8221; or others were not
            allowed to accompany them, as it was a particular ritual for them to go there, to
            establish and deepen their friendships.</p>
          <p>In May 20<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e537">5</xref>. The students&#8217; task was to
            photographically document globalization in the city. Although the project was designed
            around visual representations, other senses (and taste in particular), also played a
            role. The girls initially flocked to a caf&#233;, which&#8212;according to
            them&#8212;sold the best milkshakes in town. When moving further through the labyrinth
            of lanes in Tianzifang, they pointed out restaurants at which they had eaten with their
            parents. They touched jewelry and clothes, and tried on hats in numerous shops. Tactile
            experiences thus influenced their navigation through the area (Figure 7).1 1, when I had
            the opportunity to join students from the German School in a photo-walk project that a
            Geography teacher had set up, I chose to accompany &#8220;the girls&#8221; on their
            fieldtrip, an event that I described in more detail in Chapter 3.1 of Part I, to
            highlight my methodology. The group&#8217;s chosen research area was Tianzifang, a
            caf&#233;, gallery, and souvenir shop district that was developed from a few lanes of
            old Shanghai houses</p>
          <p>Although the visual engagement with the city that resulted from the Geography
            class&#8217;s photo-walk was particularly intense due to being a photographic analysis,
            it becomes clear that our experiences of urban spaces are always intersensorial.</p>
          <p>The method of mental maps, however, might be prone to overemphasizing visual forms of
            understanding and conceptualizing the city and might miss other sensory experiences
            possible within Shanghai. Occasionally, students tried to fit these non-visual
            perceptions on their maps, as the following example demonstrates (Figure 8).</p>
          <p>This student from a Singaporean school also includes iconic landmarks but places a
            strong emphasis on how she senses the city. Her map is filled with people, to
            demonstrate the crowdedness of the city, and images of cars and cramped, tall buildings
            to indicate the traffic and noise. The fumes behind the drawing of a car even evoke the
            smell of polluted air. Interestingly, the girl clearly juxtaposes the city against the
            area where her home and school are located, as the two arrows and the dividing line
            show. She annotates her sketches with &#8220;peaceful&#8221; and &#8220;quiet&#8221; on
            the private side, and with &#8220;noisy,&#8221; &#8220;crowded,&#8221; and
            &#8220;busy&#8221; on the other side. This second side is also labeled as &#8220;the
            city,&#8221; indicating that the school and home are not perceived as integrated parts
            of it. These maps produced by the expatriate youths support findings by scholars who
            have recently turned explicitly to exploring the role of sensorial experiences in
            cities. Geographer Melissa Butcher (<xref id="IDa7c4ced2-26e5-4fa0-a235-4753da301c34" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0c587124-a4b1-4200-9cc9-31e81968aba2">2012</xref>), for
            example, studied the intersensorial experiences of young people of different backgrounds
            in Delhi. Her qualitative study on the relationship between the city of Delhi and its
            inhabitants demonstrates that sensory involvement with public spaces is used to
            affectively dissect Delhi into spaces of inclusion and exclusion, pleasure and
            discomfort, similar to the division on the Singaporean student&#8217;s map (Figure 8).
            Butcher&#8217;s findings suggest that inhabitants link sensory experiences of the city
            on both an individual and cultural level to judgments about civil and uncivil behavior.
            The two maps shown in this chapter thus not only highlight the students&#8217; everyday
            places, but also their perspectives on the city and their own role and position within
            it. With their maps, the two girls deliver a message to themselves, their peers, and to
            me as a researcher. Olivia&#8217;s map foregrounds the image of actively consuming the
            city through nightlife and shopping. Her image is opposed to the Singaporean
            student&#8217;s image of Shanghai, of retreating and being different from the
            noisy&#8212;and maybe even perceived as uncivilized&#8212;&#8220;rest of the
            city.&#8221; By contextualizing the drawings within the students&#8217; ethnic
            backgrounds (Singapore and Belgium), one can see that the maps point to different
            positions toward and understandings of youth. However, their position towards me, a
            German researcher, also plays a role. The Belgian student demonstrates her urban
            &#8220;coolness,&#8221; while the Singaporean student may feel it necessity to point out
            that, although she is Asian, she feels estranged by China and its &#8220;noisy,&#8221;
            &#8220;crowded&#8221; cities.</p>

          <title>1.3 Concluding thoughts on managing life in the city</title>
          <p>The urban geographies students produced in their mental maps and explained in more
            detail in the interviews convey the continuous process of making sense of the city, not
            only in terms of navigation and sensory experience, but also in terms of positioning
            oneself within it&#8212;as consumers, inhabitants, or someone overwhelmed by the urban,
            sensorial landscape of Shanghai. Managing the city means managing everyday life and the
            migration experience, for instance by learning how to navigate between spaces of
            everyday practices and consumption, by giving spaces a social meaning, or by dividing
            Shanghai into a manageable, familiar area and &#8220;the rest of the city.&#8221;
            However, as cultural geographer David Crouch notes, &#8220;&#8216;making sense&#8217;
            does not equate making clear rationality but rather working our way through things,
            spaces, relations&#8221; (<xref id="ID2a2804e7-1d77-4a6e-9dd3-c9ffccadd514" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID63e6eacc-080b-4aa1-bae9-bd4844575864">2005, 31</xref>).</p>
          <p>The following chapter on housing spaces will further exemplify the divide between
            familiar areas and the rest of the city already introduced&#8212;there, the city and the
            gated communities are juxtaposed. Ways of home-making, including settling into the new
            house and various material practices, are discussed in detail. These behaviors are seen
            as a means of reconnecting with and linking former places of residence to Shanghai, thus
            creating a new network of &#8220;homes&#8221; through travel and social or broadcast
            media use. </p>

        <title>Chapter 2: Making Home(s): Houses, Belongings, and Belonging</title>
        <p>Being grounded is not necessarily about being fixed; being mobile is not necessarily
          about being detached (<xref id="ID3285d013-e747-442d-bdad-cb1e4a073310" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7201ea40-7aeb-4a06-a437-33fe2ab1bd45">Ahmed et al. 2003, 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>This chapter is concerned with the two meanings of the word &#8220;home&#8221; as it
          commonly describes both the domestic space we live in and &#8220;a space of imagined
          belonging&#8221; (Walsh 2006a, <xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e581">6</xref> Popular or
          common ideas of home often see these two spaces as coinciding. Home is frequently linked
          to one certain place, usually encompassing experiences of growing up or family life. It is
          therefore not surprising that the question of what home means for children growing up
          abroad has been a common topic in the literature that deals with expatriate youth from a
          TCK angle (Pollock and Van Reken [<xref id="IDb9c9431b-5aab-43c0-a84d-d9388e050079" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID5082239c-ace5-44bd-bee4-0a336c773304">1999</xref>] 2009; Richter
          2011; Franke 2008), which I summarized and critiqued in the introduction. Parents and
          researchers alike seem extremely concerned with the implications of growing up without one
          such place.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e588">7</xref> Thus the original definition of a
          &#8220;TCK,&#8221; as I have shown earlier, is tied to a specific notion of belonging:
          &#8220;The TCK frequently builds relationships to all of the cultures, while not having
          full ownership in any. Although elements from each culture are assimilated into the
          TCK&#8217;s life experience, the sense of belonging is in relationship to others of
          similar background&#8221; (Pollock and Van Reken [<xref id="ID6fdd252b-2830-4654-af7c-2c8c7b7f656e" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID5082239c-ace5-44bd-bee4-0a336c773304">1999</xref>] 2009, 19).125).</p>
        <p>An article by Amelie Franke (<xref id="ID7a9fe790-7831-4c5c-92cc-ba77bc591575" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID303e06ca-ad1a-41d0-8673-b3db905aa40c">2008</xref>) investigates
          notions of home and belonging among the youths she defines as &#8220;TCKs&#8221; on the
          basis of a qualitative study including a survey, in-depth interviews, and group
            discussions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e594">8</xref> Franke understands home as the
          interplay between three major connections: the connection to a place, which Franke links

          connections, and material connections. Franke finds that additional variables also play a
          role in establishing notions of home for children growing up abroad. She therefore
          complexifies the interplay of place, social connections, and material connections by
          adding the following four aspects: a) &#8220;Emotive imaginations and time,&#8221; or, how
          long one stays connected with &#8220;emotive imaginations&#8221; such as feeling safe in a
          particular place, b) the family and its ties to both, c) the parental country, and d) the
          significance of language and culture (Franke <xref id="ID3fa62e9a-77bf-4f61-879e-e6cd98a83a1f" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID303e06ca-ad1a-41d0-8673-b3db905aa40c">2008</xref>, 139&#8211;142). Franke reaches
          the following conclusion:</p>
        <p>This melting-pot of cultures results in a confusion over feelings of home [&#8230;] Many
          TCKs have reported in the interviews that they find it hard to tell where home is. [...]
          Hence, it can be assumed that TCKs' notions of home are spatially distributed over
          different countries. They feel belonging [sic] to their parental country and, at the same
          time, feel at home in their current host country and identify with former host countries.
          Thus, TCKs have &#8220;multiple homes&#8221; (<xref id="IDa9a6435b-6f7a-48a9-abde-1b9a793b15c7" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID303e06ca-ad1a-41d0-8673-b3db905aa40c">ibid., 143</xref>).</p>
        <p>Franke complements her idea of &#8220;multiple homes,&#8221; as seen in this quote, with
          the &#8220;imaginative idea&#8221; of home:</p>
        <p>TCKs live in a permanent confusion about where they belong and where they should locate
          their home. One could say, they live in a compromise: They cannot adapt to every aspect of
          a certain place they momentarily live in, because they have experienced it differently
          somewhere else and thus have a greater ability to compare and weigh up [sic] the different
          aspects of home. The more mobile TCKs are, the more abstract their idea of home becomes.
          They generally concentrate their notions of home on the more continuous factors in their
          lives, such as the family, relatives or the parental country. Thus, a TCK's home is rather
          an imaginative idea than an actual location (<xref id="IDa72ae92d-3b09-418e-915c-f40b57479635" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID303e06ca-ad1a-41d0-8673-b3db905aa40c">ibid., 148</xref>).</p>
        <p>Franke&#8217;s findings and her conceptualization of home as an imaginative idea rather
          than an actual location for children growing up on the move reinforces the original TCK
          definition. However, instead of taking this definition and Franke&#8217;s related findings
          as a priori for the international children and teenagers in Shanghai, I prefer to take a
          closer look at their own ideas of home.</p>
        <p>In order to understand the expatriate students&#8217; perspectives and what
          &#8220;home&#8221; means for these privileged migrant youths who are so often on the move,
          this chapter tightly links the teenagers&#8217; and their family&#8217;s housing and
          material practices concerned with home-making to broader concepts and imaginings of
          belonging.</p>
        <p>The first part of this chapter discusses gated community living&#8212;the reality for
          most expatriate youths in Shanghai&#8212;based on data I collected during interviews,
          visits, and my own two-week-long stay in such a community. The second part addresses
          material practices within the site of the home and pays attention to objects, food, and
          the practices associated with them, based on further interviews, a student&#8217;s photo,
          and my own visits to the youths&#8217; houses. After focusing on these housing and
          material practices in Shanghai, I then examine, in the third part of the chapter, the
          teenagers&#8217; (trans)local networks and their ties to places beyond the city&#8212;the
          &#8220;imaginative ways in which places are drawn together or kept apart&#8221; (<xref id="ID659f2cbc-da76-4314-a7dc-f2884fe2fb5c" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID206b24ad-0382-4e47-ad3a-7c8b12f8a8cd">Robinson 2010, 16</xref>)&#8212;through
          in-depth interviews. This part is concerned with places where the teenagers have lived
          before, regularly visit, or are emotionally attached to&#8212;their network of homes. The
          last section of the chapter further discusses the youths&#8217; conceptions of home and
          belonging and juxtaposes them with academic arguments.</p>

          <p>Old and new, quaint and spacious, traditional and Mediterranean, Shanghai&#8217;s

            They give families space to stretch out and are comparable to houses in the West.
            Additionally, compounds offer an instant community and make the transition to Shanghai

            but also to the emerging demand for privacy, the strong meaning associated with home
            ownership, the desire for social distinction after the experience of socialism, and an

            community housing, particularly luxurious estates, has also been seen as caused by the
            1978 reforms and their subsequent market-led urban developments&#8212;especially the
            late 1990s housing reform policies legitimizing the privatization of housing (<xref id="ID83c94645-fce8-4a61-a6a0-0b9a6b93be15" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID3c0be8b3-23d2-44b1-a425-88159df801a4">see Pow 2009 for details on

            sees gated communities as part of contemporary urban culture, which has to deal with
            material inequalities in cities and consequently aestheticizes diversity on one hand and

            of gated communities as causes for social segregation is reasonable, but also considers
            this view to be &#8220;quite normative.&#8221; By exploring three gated estates in

            gated estates and their attributed meanings differ greatly within urban China.</p>
          <p>Expatriates in Shanghai mostly live in upper-scale suburban neighborhoods with green
            lawns and luxurious facilities, which are separated from main roads by bushes and trees
            and are secured by walls and fences (Figures 9 and <xref id="IDaeb41b63-651f-4fc0-bd0a-52bf0c132d99" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID832a5190-ae8a-46c8-bc02-a8d6dc7d5a16">see Sander 2014 for further, more

            passports. Private guards, a common sight in today&#8217;s Shanghai, watch the entrance

            or Saudi Arabia have shown. The &#8220;bubble&#8221; metaphor used by my
            interview-partners (see Paul&#8217;s statements in the Introduction), as well as
            Fechter&#8217;s interviewees in Indonesia, clearly describes this demarcation.
            Expatriates&#8217; practices and perceptions of demarcation related to gated community
            living, however, differ in regard to different age-groups, as a comparison between my
            interviews with expatriate adult women in 2007 and my discussions with teenagers has

            combine security&#8212;to protect the private sphere, be protected from the
            &#8220;other,&#8221; and maintain a retreat from traffic, noise, and air
            pollution&#8212;with a familiar standard of living is important to expat parents.
            Furthermore, the neighborhood, with its many foreigners, offers a form of controlled
            heterogeneity that many of the adults I interviewed found appealing. The mothers I
            interviewed during my fieldwork in 2007 reported that, in the compounds, the neighbors
            were easier to meet because they were all in the same situation and had common
            interests. For the stay-at-home-mothers, the gated communities were particularly
            important, because, unlike their children who went to school, they did not have a zone
            for establishing friendships (<xref id="ID7deeb221-c3a2-41d6-9f4c-ccb46417a065" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID832a5190-ae8a-46c8-bc02-a8d6dc7d5a16">ibid.</xref>). Willis and

            expatriates in Hong Kong, understand the compound as the &#8220;key to the development
            of social networks,&#8221; despite also pointing out that it is a highly gendered space
            that brings mainly expatriate full-time housewives together. Parents also consider their
            children&#8217;s needs when choosing a housing option, for example, the availability of
            green spaces and the assurance of safe journeys to school. Many families therefore
            decide to settle in the vicinity of a school, at the outskirts of Shanghai. The schools
            make this choice easier by providing helpful information. For example, the German school
            provides an annotated map that lists, among other things, exact numbers of enrolled
            students that live nearby.</p>
          <p>Although the decision to opt for a refuge from the city is often linked to the safety
            and wellbeing of children (<xref id="ID8415ef2d-3837-45bf-a018-6d1434084058" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID832a5190-ae8a-46c8-bc02-a8d6dc7d5a16">Sander 2014</xref>), no
            research to my knowledge exists on young people&#8217;s perspectives and experiences
            related to that decision. My own fieldwork, however, shows that children usually benefit
            from the opportunity to roam around that is afforded by such spaces. Geographer Gill
            Valentine&#8217;s (<xref id="ID5a80044e-80d5-4cc8-abf5-b8ef998d12da" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID97eeb30a-dbb3-4161-a113-93d6ad803040">2003, 38</xref>) suggestion that the
            spatial experiences of children in the contemporary North are &#8216;&#8216;strongly
            circumscribed by adults&#8221; fittingly describes expatriate children&#8217;s reality.
            Used to this circumscription, they do not necessarily experience the compound walls as
            confining, but rather find that their confines provide them with a certain degree of
            freedom in everyday life. To the younger children, the compound is a zone where they can
            simply move around on their own (<xref id="ID868d562f-6210-4b73-b693-375556737048" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID832a5190-ae8a-46c8-bc02-a8d6dc7d5a16">Sander 2014</xref>).</p>
          <p>For teenagers, however, this positive aspect of &#8220;fenced freedom&#8221; becomes
            obsolete as they are gradually allowed to move through the city on their own. For them,
            the compound&#8217;s meaning turns from one which promotes this freedom, as experienced
            by younger children, to one of isolation and boredom (<xref id="ID8dd094b6-d7d7-4324-a27b-5c52f3786695" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID832a5190-ae8a-46c8-bc02-a8d6dc7d5a16">see Sander 2014</xref>). German teenager

            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Bjorn does not share the children&#8217;s positive evaluation of the compound as a
            space to roam free, but mainly sees it as a space that isolates him &#8220;from the
            Chinese world.&#8221; The desire for transgressing these spatial boundaries, which is
            also linked to a wish to explore city spaces and to participate in activities associated
            with youth&#8212;such as clubbing&#8212;will be explored further in Part IV,
            &#8220;Living.&#8221;</p>
          <p>The youths also cannot identify with the notion of community that the gated estates
            provide for adult expatriates. In contrast to the mothers I interviewed, teenaged Mia
            explains: </p>

              <speaker>Mia</speaker>
              <p> Well, there is one compound close by, called Jiushi. It is really big, extremely
                huge. And a lot of Germans live there. And earlier it used to really be like that;
                you knew a lot of people there, who lived close by. But now the compound is a little
                old and not really nice anymore. And by now it&#8217;s not like that anymore. Back
                then it was really like that. You had several people who you knew and you always did
                things together and so on. I used to live there. But now I don&#8217;t feel that way
                anymore.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Besides pointing out possible changes in the compound, Mia&#8217;s quote demonstrates
            that growing up also alters an individual&#8217;s perspective on gated community living.
            Her social interactions moved beyond the realm of the compound, as she became interested
            in and allowed to enter new spaces. Of her current gated community, Mia openly says
            &#8220;I don&#8217;t really do much there.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e738">11</xref> While adults find that compounds and clubhouses serve as connection points

          <p>Returning to the issue of isolation addressed by Bjorn above, it is interesting to link
            his observations&#8212;&#8220;some of them really withdraw&#8221;&#8212;to Anne

            of British diplomatic families living abroad. Her work shows that spouses of diplomats
            have considerably more contact with other diplomats and expatriates than with nationals
            of the host country. Although patterns of socializing vary, there is a correlation
            between gated community living and less socializing with locals (Coles <xref id="ID3d8ae916-5803-4abd-aa51-a1506a05cf8f" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0c59e053-cf7e-4be1-860d-8678fc0b7649">2008</xref>, 132). Gated communities are
            therefore vital to the process of drawing boundaries. Bjorn&#8217;s descriptions also
            support anthropologist Fechter&#8217;s argument that expatriates&#8212;in her case, in
            Jakarta&#8212;&#8220;are fundamentally concerned with the production and negotiation of

            not simply link the construction of boundaries to a fear of the &#8220;other,&#8221; but
            to the loss of control and &#8220;expatriates&#8217; discomfort with their bodily

          <p>In the previous chapter, I highlighted how teenage students perceive and manage the
            divide between the city and familiar spaces. Gated community living strengthens this
            divide. In the August 20<xref id="ID74820026-0748-4dc6-95e7-3ee604aee791" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe8fc0c99-8368-4d8b-9fed-e07e42d61997">Sparling 2010,

            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>This juxtaposition, again, shows how Shanghai itself often plays a marginalized role in
            daily expatriate life and is experienced as a backdrop to their otherwise &#8220;Western
            world.&#8221; The gated communities do not form part of the city. For most teenagers,
            the city outside the gates not only embodies noise and dirt (see Figure 8), but also
            excitement and coolness, as will be shown in Part IV, Chapter 2, on nightlife
            activities. The city with its global nightscapes invites the students to transgress
            borders like the compounds&#8217; walls and to explore spaces that enable them to
            establish an emotional connection to Shanghai. Focusing on the divide that Bjorn relates
            to gated community living, however, I argue that compound living makes it difficult to
            settle and build a relationship with the city, ultimately preventing Shanghai from
            becoming &#8220;home.&#8221; The gated communities in Shanghai form a space where
            expatriates see themselves as cosmopolitan, while the &#8220;other&#8221; is
            essentialized and kept outside. Expatriate youths in particular see gated communities
            mainly as spaces that disconnect them from the urban environment of Shanghai and thus
            impair their emplacement in the city.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, students also contemplate the positive aspects of gated community living,
            such as the short distance from school or their perceived safety, and point out that
            these gated estates host their homes&#8212;places they enjoy, as the following quote
            from a conversation with three of &#8220;the boys&#8221; (Don, Bjorn, and Alex)

          <p>&#8220;Home is a process and, as such, involves continual practices of home-making to
            be felt and experienced,&#8221; argues human geographer Katie Walsh (<xref id="ID45150546-a07d-4923-9371-c263e8fda840" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc2320db4-8706-401a-863b-f7121ad2fa18">2011, 516</xref>), based on her
            ethnographic research on the home-making practices of male British migrants in Dubai, a
            claim echoing the earlier work of Miller (<xref id="IDb67852a8-58b0-44e4-80bd-bd5ad6abb4a1" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDce9f32d7-2e93-496b-8c13-0c37b03e8179">2001</xref>) and Blunt and Dowling (<xref id="ID8121f780-650f-4703-928a-d2ad16949c66" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID1aa1245b-ea54-4568-908a-896d22822ecd">2006</xref>). These practices are
            particularly important to expatriate teenagers, for many of whom home as &#8220;a site
            of everyday life&#8221; may differ from actual feelings and spaces of belonging. In
            Shanghai, this process of home-making is often based on material objects, food, and the
            connectedness of these objects with family practices.</p>

            <p>It is only years later that that [sic] I now understand the power personal objects
              play in our lives, but at the time when I lost my shipment, I was appalled at how much
              stock I put in material objects. I was embarrassed, ashamed to admit how much they
              meant to me. It wasn&#8217;t so much the individual objects that I grieved for, rather
              it was what they represented as a whole; for me their value resided in where they were
              from. Together, collectively, these objects told the story of who I was, and this, as
              I gradually began to understand, was contingent on where I had lived (<xref id="ID2aff2c8c-7722-4aba-b2e6-edc964ef613a" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID2de2f332-4456-4c6d-9002-34742a0f6e35">Burns 2011, 367</xref>).</p>
            <p>In a very personal piece, Maureen Burns (<xref id="ID35fea7ff-6682-4b48-946a-5d6c813e0162" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID2de2f332-4456-4c6d-9002-34742a0f6e35">2011</xref>) discusses her own
              expatriate childhood experience and links it to a few theoretical reflections from the
              angle of visual and material culture studies. Her article shows how any sort of
              documentation as a means of representing and articulating identity is a common
              strategy among migrants to deal with moving. Burns remembers the loss of a container
              shipment that included all her belongings when she moved to the USA, for college.
              Feeling &#8220;stripped bare,&#8221; Burns recalls that she had almost nothing left
              &#8220;to communicate a whole sense of self&#8221; (<xref id="ID5bbf588f-6cd8-44c8-a621-757ca3f2e01e" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID2de2f332-4456-4c6d-9002-34742a0f6e35">ibid., 366</xref>) after the shipment
              went missing. Having only the clothes and jewelry she wore and the things from her
              suitcase left, she remembers how the rings she wore during the trip, which she had
              collected throughout her many stays abroad, &#8220;became great conversation pieces
              that simultaneously piqued other&#8217;s interest and communicated [her]
              experiences.&#8221; She sees such objects as &#8220;containers&#8221; of her life that
              protect her personal history, &#8220;ensuring against the losses of the past&#8221;

              describes how the expatriate women she studied in Kathmandu strategically shopped for
              specific art objects to use &#8220;as means of transferring knowledge and status
              between locations.&#8221; The items displayed in their homes, similar to the rings
              Burns chose to wear, invited the opportunity to communicate experiences and share
              stories. As Hindman theorizes, &#8220;the objects expatriates collect are actants in
              the social drama of Expatria, lurking in freeze-dried form, ready to spring to life in
              a new location to impart status to their possessors&#8221; (Hindman <xref id="IDbd0a914f-cac8-42a1-9a2c-6e9b0d65cf15" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID23e8c4f8-338b-4a96-a086-41e1c087cb2b">2009b, 676</xref>&#8211;677).</p>
            <p>Such meaning-laden objects, including furniture from former stays, were present in
              many of the students&#8217; homes. Most expatriate families take advantage of their
              employer&#8217;s financial support and ship their belongings around the world. A
              certain number of container shipments are usually included in the so-called packages

              British expatriate homes in Dubai, seemed to support the residents&#8217; claim to
              belonging elsewhere. The living room also housed several custom-made pieces of
              furniture in the modern Chinese style, which I came across in several expatriate
              homes, as well as in advertisements in the local expatriate press. These pieces seem
              to be favored objects for capturing memories of Shanghai. Mia&#8217;s room upstairs
              sported a similar collection of objects and images, if more intimate than those
              downstairs. It is therefore not surprising that, when I asked the teenagers from the
              German school to send me an image documenting what &#8220;home in Shanghai&#8221;
              means to them, Mia sent me the following photo of her room (Figure 11). 12, I visited
              Mia at home, I moved through a big, airy house located on a green compound. Upon
              entering the villa, my attention was immediately drawn to the walls of the hallway and
              living room, which were decorated with Chinese calligraphy and a large framed painting
              displaying the harbor of their German hometown. The painting, like those of English
              landscapes that Walsh (</p>

              belongings and, consequently, the reminders and markers of who she is. Mia&#8217;s
              room shows that some items, for instance the Shanghai pillow, might have been
              purchased with the future in mind, like the objects belonging to Hindman&#8217;s

              students&#8217; culinary practices in London, showing how food can create &#8220;the
              experience of home as a sensory totality.&#8221; By exploring food culture, Petridou
              sees home as located &#8220;away from its physical structures of the house&#8221; but
              still linked to the material world, understanding it &#8220;as a practice and a
              combination of processes through which its inhabitants acquire a sense of history and
              identity&#8221; (<xref id="ID898df997-2c89-4036-ab38-9344a02adeb9" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID41731c15-d6f4-4a6a-9370-965d61ea623f">ibid., 88</xref>). I can relate to the
              importance of food in feeling at home. While I enjoyed exploring my Chinese
              surroundings by dining out in local restaurants, eateries, noodle shops, and street
              food stalls, I occasionally prepared &#8220;home&#8221; food at home.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1086">16</xref> However, I was startled to find that, for
              many students, these clear place/taste relationships were dissolving, or had even
              turned the other way around. While I had learned from the students&#8217; maps and
              participant observation that the teenagers enjoyed eating out in Western-style
              restaurants, I initially underestimated the role of the ayi,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1092">17</xref> the maid or nanny, until a discussion with Paul drew my
              attention to the issue. </p>

              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>The students experience Chinese food at home, prepared by the family&#8217;s maid,
              and the city of Shanghai therefore often provides the international food they crave.
              Of course some of the students enjoy their native cuisine at home, as an ayi working
              for several foreign families told me. Although she would cook Chinese food two or
              three times per week, she was particularly proud of her skills preparing pizza, making
              spinach pies, and baking whole wheat bread. Not in all households, however, is the
              preparation of meals left to the ayi. After one interview with three of &#8220;the
              boys,&#8221; Bjorn made everyone jealous by saying that his mom was awaiting him at
              home, along with homemade Spaghetti Bolognese. Apparently this was exceptional, as
              many expatriate families rely on their maid for food preparation. Generally,
              &#8220;home&#8221; food is noticeably missed. Paul, who grew up in the United States,
              for instance, would crave Slurpees (iced, flavored drinks). Most of the German boys
              commented on missing kebabs, or food they associated with their grandmothers&#8217;
              cooking, such as potato salad or roast beef. The category of home food, however,
              becomes questionable when Chinese dishes become an integrated part of the diet at home
              and &#8220;home food&#8221;&#8212;Western dishes&#8212;part of dining out in the city.
              For expatriate students, food therefore rather relates to broader ideas of home, as
              Mia&#8217;s account on the relationship between certain food smells and feelings of
              being at home illustrates: </p>

                <p>Well, Germany is my home, but Germany as a country. This is the case as soon as I
                  step out of the airport and smell the bakery aromas. That simply is home. That is
                  not a specific place, but this feeling that I only have in Germany.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Certain practices surrounding food, however, can encourage the process of
              home-making, as Bjorn&#8217;s pride in his mother&#8217;s Bolognese shows. The fact
              that his mother&#8212;and not the maid&#8212;prepared the dish was also crucial to its
              value.</p>

            <p>Mia&#8217;s, Bjorn&#8217;s, and their peers&#8217; experiences show that material
              culture plays a significant role in making home a meaningful place for
              teenagers&#8217; everyday lives. Further details from Mia&#8217;s case highlight the
              reciprocal relationship between materiality and human practices in the process of
              turning a new place into a home.</p>
            <p>Mia, who has moved several times in her life, always draws a lot of strength from her
              family. She and her two siblings have very close relationships and it seems to me that
              shared family activities are an important coping mechanism for her. This impression is
              confirmed when she tells me about her struggles when her father and older sister had
              to leave Shanghai due to job obligations and college. Mia, her mother, and brother
              stayed on in Shanghai, however, for Mia to finish her last year of school. During our
              interview a year later, she recalls:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s51">
                <speaker>Mia</speaker>
                <p>There was a difficult moment when we came to know that my father had to move.
                  That really wasn&#8217;t great. Especially in the beginning, because my father and
                  sister both stayed in Germany. And the three of us came back to move into this
                  house [in Shanghai]. We had lived in a different house before. That was no easy
                  time. I was really&#8230; The first month, every evening, I was always sad, I
                  cried a lot. It was okay during the day when I was at school, but [difficult] in
                  the evenings at home. Our family life changed a lot. We all used to sit around the
                  dinner table, and now we are only three, and usually someone is not there. Well,
                  it really did change a lot. Sometimes we have to make plans: Okay, let&#8217;s all
                  go out for dinner together, so we can all talk for hours again. Otherwise you
                  talk, sure, but only two of us, rarely all three.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Mia misses her father and sister, but she also misses the communal dinner as a family
              routine that is crucial to rendering the place of residence into home. When I inquire
              about her strategies for dealing with the new situation at home, she explains: </p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s52">
                <speaker>Mia</speaker>
                <p>Well, since we have become such a small family, I plan a lot of activities. So I
                  am really out a lot, simply because... Well, I used to be happy to be home alone
                  once in a while, because it so rarely happened. If you are five people, it rarely
                  happens. And now I don&#8217;t enjoy being home alone, then I am like,
                  &#8220;Okay, what do I do now?&#8221; So when I am home alone I usually go
                  downtown or just do something with friends. [&#8230;] My calendar is actually
                  always full. That&#8217;s sort of my strategy. Well, sure, I also think a lot. But
                  sitting at home all the time, everything is kind of crashing down around you the
                  whole time, but you can&#8217;t do anything about it, and you&#8217;re just
                  sitting around stupidly.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Since these dinners no longer convey the sense of home, Mia prefers to spend time
              outside with her friends, establishing new practices of home-making for herself in
                Shanghai.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1182">18</xref> Likewise, many of the
              expatriate students learn to live with fathers who are often absent. Eleven-year-old
              Allen, for instance, only sees his father on the weekends, when he returns from his
              work site in a minor Chinese city. </p>
            <p>It is evident that the expatriate teenagers&#8217; material practices of creating
              &#8220;home&#8221; are continuous negotiations, not only of home as a site, but also
              of processes of emplacement in the city and of larger understandings of belonging, as
              Walsh succinctly phrases it: &#8220;Domestic materialities can play a highly
              significant role in migrants&#8217; negotiation of geographies of belonging,
              residence, landscape and place&#8221; (<xref id="IDce1c8516-c3f4-48f2-8116-57cc1a1d5bfb" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc2320db4-8706-401a-863b-f7121ad2fa18">2011, 516</xref>). Basu and Coleman
              argue that material culture shows how migrants not only change their place, but also
              &#8220;their place within the &#8216;world&#8217; they have entered&#8221; (<xref id="IDd47c0518-7f7e-4917-a194-fa55c3982bd8" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48b3e79f-3eb2-4f1c-93ec-ab9b6db71b2c">2008, 324</xref>). Having laid open the
              connections between belongings and belonging, the next section explores the latter in
              more detail and links theoretical positions to the students&#8217; own perspectives on

            belonging</title>
          <p>Diasporic identities are at once local and global. They are networks of transnational
            identification encompassing &#8220;imagined&#8221; and &#8220;encountered&#8221;
            communities (<xref id="IDb925d3df-c4a0-429b-9d00-85b6d664311e" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 196</xref>).</p>
          <p>The questions of belonging and home are central topics in migration studies and have
            led to various conceptualizations. Researchers across different disciplines have
            analyzed and conceptualized transnational migrants&#8217; practices and understood
            migrant forms of belonging, often &#8220;through abstracted spatial tropes&#8221; (<xref id="IDf0d2d5a4-952c-43d7-9eb5-d8a95d29d1de" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0313e4ae-8f49-4ee9-9c74-5a6dd5670f02">Walsh 2006a, 124</xref>), putting
            emphasis on the state of &#8220;in-betweenness&#8221; and the multiple ties migrants
            maintain. For instance, Vertovec writes, in regard to these multiple ties:</p>
          <p>Many migrants today intensively conduct activities and maintain substantial commitments
            that link them with significant others [&#8230;] who dwell in nation-states other than
            those in which the migrants themselves reside. Migrants now maintain such connections
            through uses of technology, travel and financial mechanisms more intensely than ever
            before possible (<xref id="ID266c21bd-c259-4f9f-9c5b-4cbc9612926f" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID1990d32c-25ab-4eca-86dd-d07f03ba71a3">Vertovec 2004, 970&#8211;971</xref>).</p>
          <p>With the rise of multiple connections, Simon Turner (2008, <xref id="IDbbf4ccb2-1e96-43df-950e-6177911a9e40" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7880ac08-9f94-43f2-b53e-5db8dcda945c">1994</xref>] 2009).1050) argues that
            &#8220;transnational migration and diasporic communities contain an inherent spatial
            tension, as populations no longer &#8216;fit&#8217; their territory&#8212;belonging to
            several places at once.&#8221; Other concepts using &#8220;abstracted spatial
            tropes&#8221; to understand the complex processes of linking places and people across
            borders and the migrant&#8217;s &#8220;position&#8221; in these networks include
            &#8220;transnational social spaces&#8221; (Pries 2001), &#8220;ethnoscapes&#8221;

          <p>The two preceding parts of this chapter have therefore stressed the experiences and
            practices revolving around the concrete site of the home and its embeddedness in the
            larger context of gated community living in Shanghai, with its inherent demarcation from
            local society. But how are these practices of settling in and demarcation related to the
            movement of expatriate youths and global, flowing, and shifting connections and
            identifications? The final section of this chapter consequently investigates
            students&#8217; own perspectives on belonging by investigating their relationships with
            places and people beyond Shanghai, and to abstract or imagined ideas or emotions as
            emerging from their experiences of mobility and home-making. </p>

            <title>Talking about home and belonging</title>
            <p>Following the importance given to home and belonging in previous research, I
              discussed the topic during all interviews with students. During these conversations, I
              sometimes feared that the term &#8220;home&#8221; referred to a quite prescriptive
              idea and that students would feel obliged to position themselves or state alliances to
              nationality or places of &#8220;origin.&#8221; However, I still considered
              &#8220;home,&#8221; as a part of everyday vocabulary, the best choice. I then tried to
              open up the discussion by asking not only &#8220;Where is home for you?&#8221; but by
              further asking: &#8220;What do you usually reply when someone asks you where you are
              from?&#8221; I initiated discussion following these questions and asked the students
              how they felt about them, and whether these were easy or difficult questions to
              answer. It became apparent that, for many students, the answers heavily depended on
              who would ask them, a trend that points out how performative and relational the
              politics of home are. The following section presents these interviews and a discussion
              in the form of mind maps that were produced at the German school. The students were
              asked to discuss their ideas of &#8220;Heimat&#8221; (belonging/home) in written form,
              in class. These mind maps show that home is a term which brings about many
              associations and emotions (Figure 12).</p>
            <p>Covering a variety of issues, the students refer to the places where they grew up and
              &#8220;childhood,&#8221; as well as &#8220;memories&#8221; and
              &#8220;experiences&#8221; in general. They list &#8220;family&#8221; and the presence
              of relatives and pets. Likewise, friends feature prominently in all four sketches, and
              are linked to comments on community and trust. &#8220;School&#8221; also finds its way
              onto one of the posters. </p>
            <p>The teenagers also discuss sensorial experiences, such as climate and food, and
              familiar cultural practices, such as festivals and language. Houses and apartments as
              well as objects such as photos, videos, and music appear on the maps, too.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Heimat&#8221; also evokes comments on patriotism, birthplace, nationality,
              nation states (&#8220;Germany, China&#8221;) and mega-events like the World Cup
              (&#8220;Nation stands behind its country roots for it&#8221;).</p>
            <p>Moreover, all the sketches display discussions on media, listing social networks and
              services such as Facebook, Gowalla, Twitter, Myspace, and forms of communication such
              as VoIP (Voice over IP) and instant messenger platforms. Next to these ways of staying
              in touch with friends and family, German online media is also mentioned as a way that
              many of the students relate to their country of citizenship (Figure 13). </p>
            <p>Emotions such as feeling accepted or safe play a prominent role in their written
              discussions of home, with students noting that home is &#8220;where I can be
              myself,&#8221; with &#8220;people who really know you,&#8221; or that &#8220;home is
              where the heart is.&#8221; Some remarks refer to individual aspects of and ideas about
              belonging, such as &#8220;everyone imagines home differently.&#8221; </p>
            <p>&#8220;Moving&#8221; is mentioned in connection to the question &#8220;Does
              &#8216;home&#8217; change?&#8221; Other comments simply inquire &#8220;no home?&#8221;
              or &#8220;homeless?&#8221; On one poster, students ask &#8220;What is homeless?&#8221;
              and answer their own question with &#8220;when you feel you are wanted nowhere and
              have no relation to any specific place&#8221; and &#8220;neither place nor
              people.&#8221;</p>
            <p> &#8220;Heimat&#8221; evokes various associations and questions among students. The
              students make it clear that it is something they continuously negotiate and relate to
              &#8220;childhood,&#8221; &#8220;family,&#8221; &#8220;friends,&#8221;
              &#8220;nationality,&#8221; &#8220;media,&#8221; &#8220;everyday practices,&#8221;
              &#8220;experiences,&#8221; &#8220;memories,&#8221; and &#8220;feelings.&#8221; It
              seems that, through moving, contemplating the notion of home becomes even more
              relevant. The next sections therefore look at several individual students&#8217;
              thoughts about and negotiations of their subjective ideas of home.</p>

                  home a bit. At nine years old. And then you come to China and it&#8217;s a huge
                  city, and you say &#8220;oh.&#8221; The style of life, there is a big change in
                  the style of life.</p>

            <p>However, due to the fact that continuity and &#8220;everything staying a certain
              way&#8221; is not a given for children moving transnationally, many of my interviewees
              have difficulty pointing out what home is to them. Japanese student Kazuo, whom I
              interviewed at the Singaporean school, explains:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s56">
                <speaker>Kazuo</speaker>
                <p>Home is like, when you ask that question in Shanghai, like, in Shanghai. I have
                  no home in Japan. So, I cannot answer my home is in Japan. In Japan, I always,
                  like, &lt;x&gt; grew up in other places. So I cannot say &#8220;where are you
                  from?&#8221; &#8220;Japan.&#8221; I am not sure.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Like Kazuo, the international students with their transnational ties and connections
              to multiple locations have to negotiate the term and find a way to go beyond
              prioritizing one place over the other. In the eyes of expatriate youths, home is
              nothing fixed or easy to define.</p>
            <p>Some students deal with the problem of defining home by claiming home as &#8220;back
              home.&#8221; For instance, eleven-year-old Allen, who has already lived in several
              places, sees his home tied to the current house his parents own in the US:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s57">
                <speaker>Allen</speaker>
                <p>I&#8217;d say South Carolina, cause that&#8217;s the house there right now. But I
                  am originally from Chicago, Illinois, but I never actually, I don&#8217;t have any
                  memories in my brain about it.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>This definition of home is related to the way his whole family conceptualizes their
              stay abroad. His parents&#8217; influence, as well as how his family defines
              &#8220;home&#8221; as the house in the US, can be seen in his account of traveling
              back to the US in the summer and the consistent use of &#8220;we&#8221; in his
              narrative:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s58">
                <speaker>Allen</speaker>
                <p>One other disadvantage for me is, living in China is very far away from my home
                  country. And where we have a house in the USA is the farthest it could be away
                  from us, in the US. Because it is east of the US, so we have to ride a
                  fifteen-hours flight home, and we have to ride another two-hour flight back to our
                  house. And then plus driving hours.</p>

            <p>For seventeen-year-old Karina, Shanghai is her fourth city of residence. However, she
              prefers Prague, which she links to her friends&#8217; and family&#8217;s presence:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s63">
                <speaker>Interviewer</speaker>
                <p>But you feel comfortable in both places, somehow?</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s64">
                <speaker>Karina</speaker>
                <p>I feel more comfortable in Prague. Because I have my friends and my family there.
                  And I was simply born there. I spent the biggest part of my life there. And, yes,
                  I have a much closer relationship to Prague than to Shanghai. Shanghai, I think,
                  okay, I moved here because of my father and I get my diploma and goodbye. And then
                  I maybe come back some time for my studies. But I always try to spend as little
                  time here as possible. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Karina and Allen both actively maintain their ties to what they consider their true
              &#8220;home,&#8221; Prague and the house in the USA. Shanghai is only a transitory
              space to them. Karina not only defines Prague as her home, but also Shanghai as a
              place where she tries to spend &#8220;as little time as possible.&#8221; She points
              this out during a follow-up interview that I conduct with her one year after her
              initial move to Shanghai. Karina had difficulties with the &#8220;homing&#8221;
              process and, even after one year, limits her relationship to Shanghai to seeing it as
              merely an aspect of her father&#8217;s job. However, just before the interview, she
              had returned from a summer in Prague and was really missing her family and friends
              there. In short, for some students, home is connected to &#8220;elsewhere,&#8221; to
              necessary travel, and to missing people and places.</p>
            <p>Keeping the migratory experiences of the young actors in this study in mind, it is
              not surprising to find that their transient relationship with Shanghai might make it
              difficult for some of these students to consider it home. Tamara, who was twelve years
              old when we talked during a group discussion at a British school, explained: </p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s65">
                <speaker>Tamara</speaker>
                <p>For me, I think I should call China home, because I feel more comfortable here
                  than &lt;x&gt;. Erm, but I don&#8217;t really know if China should be my home,
                  because I think I will be moving somewhere else after three or more years.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>For Tamara&#8212;who grew up in Singapore and China&#8212;the fear of leaving, of
              moving on, makes it difficult to relate to Shanghai as home, even though she
              &#8220;feels comfortable&#8221; there. Shanghai can only be a temporary home, a
              transit space. Giovanni has a similar understanding. He describes himself as
              &#8220;feeling safe&#8221; and &#8220;a little bit like at home&#8221; in
                Shanghai,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1335">20</xref> but when he further reflects
              on the question of home, he argues that, although he has not lived in
              Switzerland&#8212;the country of his parents and nationality&#8212;for three years
              now, he would, nevertheless, call it home. His major argument is that he is only
              &#8220;temporarily&#8221; in Shanghai, &#8220;like a long holiday&#8221; (wie lange
              Ferien). Again, his quote shows how Shanghai is perceived as a transient space, a
              temporary home.</p>
            <p>Giovanni&#8217;s contemplations, however, also point to the possibility of having two
              homes simultaneously, Switzerland and Shanghai, an idea many students present in
              interviews. In her writings on diaspora, Avtar Brah (<xref id="IDf2ef8594-5252-4dd5-8a7d-8840998322a4" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">1996</xref>) answers the question of
              what &#8220;home&#8221; means with a conceptualization based on distinguishing
              &#8220;homing desire&#8221; from the &#8220;desire for homeland,&#8221; which she sees
              as two different simultaneous processes and discourses (<xref id="ID5166502c-c8ab-4c66-a979-49d166c242d9" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">1996</xref>, 16):</p>
            <p>On the one hand, &#8220;home&#8221; is a mythic place of desire in the diasporic
              imagination. In this sense it is a place of no return, even if it is possible to visit
              the geographical territory that is seen as the place of &#8220;origin.&#8221; On the
              other hand, home is also the lived experience of a locality. Its sounds and smells,
              its heat and dust, balmy summer evenings, or the excitement of the first snowfall,
              shivering winter evenings, somber grey skies in the middle of the day &#8230; all
              this, as mediated by the historically specific everyday of social relations (<xref id="ID7e5b696f-4ff6-4b11-b90f-7ec20a03eb70" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 192</xref>).</p>
            <p>Akin to Avtar Brah&#8217;s two notions of home, eighteen-year-old Matthias explains:
              &#8220;I think, like, both are kind of home. Maybe right now I'd say rather here [in
              Shanghai] than Germany.&#8221; Later, however, Matthias identifies home less
              hesitatingly: &#8220;For me. Germany.&#8221; This seeming contradiction, having two
              homes, is not surprising. Students have the sense that they have to choose, to decide.
              Yet, they maintain emotional connections to both places.</p>
            <p>Sixteen-year-old Mia&#8217;s musings that I discussed above also illustrate
              Brah&#8217;s conceptualizations of home. Her reflections on material practices and
              &#8220;home-making&#8221; in Shanghai have shown that, while she clearly considers
              where she lives as &#8220;at home&#8221; (Zuhause), her sense of where she truly
              belongs, of a true &#8220;home&#8221; (Heimat), is tied to Germany as a country, and
              is symbolized by the smell of bakeries. She comments on this dualistic concept: </p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s66">
                <speaker>Mia</speaker>
                <p>You don&#8217;t have a place where you can say, this is where I&#8217;ve spent
                  all my life or big parts of my life. That&#8217;s where I belong, because I have
                  lived here [in Shanghai] the longest. But still I would&#8230; no idea&#8230; it
                  is my home [Zuhause], but it&#8217;s not my home [Heimat].</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>The distinction she draws in German between &#8220;Zuhause&#8221; and
              &#8220;Heimat,&#8221; perhaps comparable to the English distinction between
              one&#8217;s house and one&#8217;s home, coincides with Brah&#8217;s (<xref id="ID9f7964dc-b3e8-4409-a581-157e54f02f1b" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">1996</xref>) two formulations of home.
              However, discussing the matter further, Mia stresses that being at home is, due to her
              experiences, not only tied to a single place in her life, but is multi-local.</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s67">
                <speaker>Mia</speaker>
                <p>It&#8217;s really like that! Also, if you go somewhere you have lived before. For
                  instance, when I go with my family to Singapore. Even years later. You don&#8217;t
                  even have to remember it that well. Just at that moment when you are riding in a
                  taxi and you look out the window and see these palm trees. That is simply home.
                  It&#8217;s as if you were coming home! </p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Mia&#8217;s descriptions remind us that Brah&#8217;s definition, although at first
              tempting us to see a dualistic form of home for migrants, encompasses the
              &#8220;double, triple, or multi-placedness of &#8216;home&#8217;&#8221; (<xref id="ID122e85b8-ab60-4b7d-b338-d51156a53168" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 194</xref>). Brah&#8217;s
              definitions of home have to be understood as applicable for multiple locations. This
              dualistic view of home, however, is widespread in migration studies. When social
              anthropologist Steven Vertovec writes about the transformation, through
              transnationalism, of &#8220;the everyday social worlds of individuals and families in
              both migrant sending and receiving contexts&#8221; (<xref id="IDac1c1488-1951-4c55-8cd4-e0f51c624854" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID1990d32c-25ab-4eca-86dd-d07f03ba71a3">Vertovec 2004, 974</xref>), he
              summarizes various concepts describing &#8220;practices of exchange, communication and

              &#8220;migrants&#8217; orientational bifocality&#8221; draws from concepts such as

              Guarnizo&#8217;s concept of a transnational habitus which is linked to a &#8220;dual

              While Vertovec&#8217;s concept of &#8220;bifocality&#8221; may hold for many cases of
              migration, it is not applicable to all expat youths, due to their high mobility and
              bicultural families. While we note that, for these children, the terms
              &#8220;Zuhause&#8221; (at home) and &#8220;Heimat&#8221; (home) do not coincide, the
              following accounts will demonstrate the need for concepts which go beyond

              importance of the imaginary in connections between cities, the &#8220;imaginative ways
              in which places are drawn together or kept apart.&#8221; She therefore includes people
              who physically stay in one region in the process of connecting places when she argues
              that &#8220;residents are always in the process of preparing to leave for an imagined
              elsewhere, that they already know much about other cities or live [sic] an imaginary
              world that is both here and there. Within a topological imagination, making
              one&#8217;s way in a city commonly entrains a wide diversity of other places&#8221;
              (Robinson <xref id="ID1d4c099e-c0a1-4705-b701-159e0747c4f7" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID206b24ad-0382-4e47-ad3a-7c8b12f8a8cd">2010, 16</xref>). Robinson&#8217;s
              argument, which I presented in the introduction and on which I expand here, shows that
              ties to other places are vivid in our everyday lives. Moving through and living in
              Shanghai is thus constantly tied to elsewhere. However, for expatriate youths, these
              ties are not only based on imaginary scenarios (centering on future places of
              residence or travel destinations), but on memories and sensory experiences from
              elsewhere. Due to their many moves, the actors of my study are able to constantly draw
              from their memories of other places. Marco, a student at the German school and the
              child of a Brazilian-German marriage, for instance, stresses his positive

                <p>I have lived in Leverkusen all my life. But we were also often at my
                  grandparents, on one side [of the family] in the Black Forest and, on the other
                  side, in Brazil. Yes, I have so much there that I feel very connected to both
                  places, because we really spent a lot of time there. Usually we&#8217;d go there
                  once a month, to my grandpa&#8217;s in the Black Forest. And the whole summer

            <p>In this interview, Marco openly voices his difficulties explaining his attachment to
              several places at once. His comments read as if the questions about where home is
              pressure him to make a choice. At first refraining from using the word
              &#8220;home,&#8221; he makes it clear that he feels connected to former places of
              residence as well as to the different places his family came from. He reluctantly uses
              the German term &#8220;Heimat&#8221; to refer to the city he grew up in, only to
              immediately state his uncertainty about this choice and to make it clear that he
              cannot state preferences or put his relationships with those places into words. His
              life is embedded in a network of different places in which family relations play a key
              role.</p>
            <p>Paul, whose case I presented in the Introduction, is also the child of a
              mixed-nationality marriage, and similarly grew up in several places, although he and
              his parents moved more often. In contrast to Marco, Paul describes his multi-local
              experiences by stating his non-attachment to places. He defines home as
              &#8220;wherever I am staying.&#8221;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1462">22</xref>

            <p>Other students see their connections with multiple places as a potential status
              symbol. As Alex notes, when describing his experience to others:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s73">
                <speaker>Alex</speaker>
                <p>That is also bragging a little. And simply interesting, I guess. I would be
                  interested in someone who has lived in Shanghai for three years.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Alex is proud of his expat lifestyle and ties his experience to cosmopolitanism
              rather than seeing difficulties with negotiating what &#8220;home&#8221; means. One
              could also describe Alex&#8217;s classmate Kressi&#8217;s outlook as cosmopolitan.
              Kressi, who was fifteen years old when I met her and who moved from Germany to
              Shanghai as a toddler, verbalizes her idea of home by tracing her relations to
              relatives and friends in other places and by fixing home as an emotional state.</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s74">
                <speaker>Kressi</speaker>
                <p>It is this feeling. That&#8217;s why I say &#8220;the world is my home.&#8221;
                  The whole world. The world is my home, because there is something. My uncle is in
                  America. I like to go shopping there and love it there. And all my friends, who
                  have now moved on, are in Germany.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Her simultaneous attachment to many places is based on people, practices, and
              emotions. These experiences of places lead to the feeling that she has a whole network
              of homes, which emerged from her family&#8217;s multiple migrations over generations.
              Thus for expatriate youths, home is always multifocal: a connection of several places,
              people, and practices. These connections can be understood as
              &#8220;rhizomatic.&#8221; </p>

              &#8220;the expatriate family can spring from the soil again&#8221;&#8212;due to the
              tendency among expats to collect objects which help them articulate and recreate
              personal histories and positions in new places&#8212;to Gilles Deleuze and Felix

              rhizome. Such a rhizome, as these students&#8217; comments illustrate, is not only a
              connection of objects, but also of places, people, and practices. Deleuze and Guattari
                (<xref id="IDf7643568-4dcc-48cf-b378-f278519efb39" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">1987</xref>) employ the image of the
              rhizome &#8220;as subterranean stem&#8221; to encourage a new way of thinking about
              the representation and interpretation of data and the production of knowledge. They
              chose the image of the rhizome in contrast to that of &#8220;roots and radicles&#8221;
              which they see as having dominated our ways of analyzing thought until now (<xref id="ID49424837-0cb0-46ad-80f3-23f9ddb9ea9e" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 6</xref>). Unlike a tree or its
              root, &#8220;which plots a point, fixes an order&#8221; (<xref id="ID24de8da3-d5df-44a6-b53d-b88491623a85" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 7</xref>) the rhizome
              &#8220;connects any point to any other point, and its traits are not necessarily
              linked to traits of the same nature; it brings into play very different regimes of
              signs, and even nonsign states&#8221; (<xref id="IDda1ef04c-3cad-4824-9621-623b87faa829" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 21</xref>). It is in the same
              manner that the rhizomatic home includes different groups of people, practices,
              places, material goods, and senses of belonging. The rhizome, Deleuze and Guattari
              argue, underlies &#8220;principles of connection and heterogeneity&#8221; (<xref id="ID3a13385f-6ee3-415a-9bd8-905c3afa93e3" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 7</xref>) and may be broken, but
              is not hindered by breakage, since ruptures are inherent to it. </p>
            <p>Every rhizome contains lines of segmentarity according to which it is stratified,
              territorialized, organized, signified, attributed, etc., as well as lines of
              deterritorialization down which it constantly flees. There is a rupture in the rhizome
              whenever segmentary lines explode into a line of flight, but the line of flight is
              part of the rhizome. These lines always tie back to one another (<xref id="IDc7a12277-dd86-45f7-a536-ba9d6f5de03f" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 9</xref>).</p>
            <p>This ceaseless connection despite ruptures is also visible in the students&#8217;
              perceptions of home&#8212;moves, as ruptures, do not interrupt feelings of belonging
              to places or people that, at first glance, seem cut off. Deleuze and Guattari suggest
              that a rhizome, which has no beginning or end, cannot be traced but only mapped (<xref id="ID033b9056-7223-434d-b163-b2ce193f81c4" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 12</xref>), because it is
              &#8220;always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo&#8221; (<xref id="ID12cc7e76-6192-4418-8d55-36955606d5fe" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 25.</xref>). This in-betweeness
              of the rhizome, of the notion of home is, for Kressi, the child of second generation
              migrants from Hong Kong and Vietnam in Germany, who was born in Germany but grew up in
              Shanghai with transnational family ties to several places, simultaneously linked to
              challenges in cultural identity:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s75">
                <speaker>Kressi</speaker>
                <p>The thing is, some people can simply say: &#8220;I am from Germany, but I live in
                  Shanghai.&#8221; In a sense I am, yes, I am actually German. Because my Chinese
                  isn&#8217;t that good. I also have a German passport and I grew up as a German.
                  But the problem is that I don&#8217;t look German. And I look like a Chinese or
                  something, but I just live here. But then Shanghai, nonetheless, somehow became my
                  home [Heimat], just because everything I really know is here.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Feeling at home is also tied to questions of identity and the right to claim a place
              as &#8220;home.&#8221; &#8220;Not looking German,&#8221; as Kressi puts it, thus makes
              the claim to Germany as her &#8220;Heimat&#8221;&#8212;according to Brah&#8217;s first
              definition, the place of &#8220;origin&#8221;&#8212;difficult. Home is tied to the
              politics of identity and belonging, even for affluent, privileged migrants. In
              Brah&#8217;s words:</p>
            <p>The question of home, therefore, is intrinsically linked with the way in which
              processes of inclusion or exclusion operate and are subjectively experienced under
              given circumstances. It is centrally about our political and personal struggles over
              the social regulation of &#8220;belonging&#8221; (<xref id="ID575ad962-0201-4ac7-8370-269a7221c20c" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 192</xref>).</p>
            <p>Kressi&#8217;s quote supports Brah&#8217;s argument that the question of home is tied
              to the &#8220;social regulation of &#8216;belonging.&#8217;&#8221; She explains the
              difficulties her non-German looks, and the fact that she does not speak Chinese or own
              a Chinese passport, cause her in terms of defining her home to others. Nonetheless,
              Kressi also explains how processes of emplacement&#8212;&#8220;because simply
              everything I really know is here&#8221;&#8212;make Shanghai her home. Her emphasis
              that living in Shanghai makes her see the place as home resonates well with
              Brah&#8217;s argument that &#8220;the double, triple, or multi-placedness of
              &#8216;home&#8217; in the imaginary [sic] of people in the diaspora does not mean that
              such groups do not feel anchored in the place of settlement&#8221; (<xref id="ID82cc981a-0840-45da-9fe7-8d3dac461add" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 194</xref>). Additionally,
              Kressi&#8217;s case shows that the idea of defining &#8220;back home&#8221; can become
              difficult. </p>
            <p>For some of the students, especially those who move quite often and/or have parents
              of different nationalities, Brah&#8217;s first understanding of home as &#8220;a
              mythic place of desire in the diasporic imagination&#8221; (<xref id="ID315c6832-04ae-40de-94c7-e43b3f928d00" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 192</xref>) seems to become
              less important and a source of conflict within the family. Nine-year-old Jacob, the
              son of Malay parents, describes how he has difficulty seeing Malaysia as a place he
              could call home:</p>

                  Beijing, because when I was in Beijing, for the first few years, I was just a tiny
                  thing and I wouldn&#8217;t remember anything. And when we moved to a different
                  place, besides China, like Bangkok, I totally forgot all my Mandarin.

                  weeks I told my mom: &#8220;What's the date we are leaving?&#8221;</p>

                <p>It's not home. [&#8230;] It is such a hard question to answer that. Where are you

            <p>Emily evidently does not feel &#8220;part of that place&#8221; that is supposed to be
              &#8220;home.&#8221; Returning to Brah&#8217;s concept, Malaysia can, in Emily&#8217;s
              case, be seen as constructed in the first category of home, by the parents, as a
              &#8220;mythic place of desire&#8221; (<xref id="ID6e8a89d4-d75e-463e-85c5-75a88d34fe8e" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">Brah 1996, 192</xref>). However, when
              Emily arrives, she cannot call it home, because home&#8212;for her and her brother
              alike&#8212;is linked to Brah&#8217;s second conceptualization of home as &#8220;the
              lived experience of a locality.&#8221; When she discusses this on a meta-level by
              stressing that her brother &#8220;has a different concept,&#8221; she only refers to
              her brother' still calling Malaysia home. That the siblings&#8217; difficulties to
              accept Malaysia as home can lead to intergenerational difficulties can be seen in the
              following narration by Emily: </p>

                <p>Yeah, cause I think, as a parent they have all lived in one country until they
                  grow up. And then they move. So, I think they don't really know how it is like for
                  the rest to move. And move and move.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>The siblings&#8217; discussion of their relationships to multiple places focuses on
              the intergenerational conflicts arising from their parents seeing Malaysia as their
              supposed &#8220;home&#8221; and the children&#8217;s refusal to accept the idea of a
              fixed home in a world of flux. For expatriate youths, ideas of home and belonging can
              conflict with those of their family or with their nationality due to how their
              experiences and emplacement processes differ. The issue is further complicated when
              they feel that others could reject their claims of belonging due, for instance, to
              their physical appearance&#8212;as Kressi mentioned in her interview.</p>
            <p>Some students, however, clearly see Shanghai as their home. Two students from the
              German School, Andrea and Antonia, both members of &#8220;the girls,&#8221; refer to
              Shanghai as their home. Andrea links this claim to her having an everyday routine
              there. She explains how she feels after returning from summer breaks in Germany:</p>
            <p>
              <speech id="s103">
                <speaker>Andrea</speaker>
                <p>I like coming back here. [&#8230;] Now I can relax again. Now it is routine
                  again. Now I don&#8217;t have to live out of my suitcase anymore and so on. In a
                  way, you come back home.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Antonia&#8217;s point of view is similar to Andrea&#8217;s; she emphasizes the
              &#8220;normality&#8221; of coming &#8220;home&#8221; to Shanghai even more.</p>

                  &lt;L&gt; I don&#8217;t think there is a big difference between us and other
                  people. Just home again. I go to my house and say hello to my dog, my ayi , my
                  house, my bed.</p>

                <p>There is no difference. Well, I don&#8217;t know how it is supposed to be
                  different from other people.</p>
              </speech>
            </p>
            <p>Andrea and Antonia both consider Shanghai to be their home due to their current
              residence and routine practices in the city. Antonia&#8217;s statement, &#8220;I
              don&#8217;t know how it is supposed to be different from other people,&#8221;
              demonstrates how she has no difficulty defining the city as her home. Her answer also
              points to an underlying annoyance provoked by the question. This might be because she
              senses that my position as a researcher is based on a latent assumption that the
              mobile lifestyle of expatriates brings about difficulties, an assumption which she
              refuses to accept. Her seeming annoyance may be further related to the fact that,
              despite growing up in Shanghai, being fluent in Chinese, and referring to herself as
              &#8220;Shanghainese,&#8221; as the child of a mixed-marriage and a German national,
              she might not be accepted as such. She attributes her diverse notions about feeling at
              home to her living in the city, although claiming that belonging in Shanghai often
              remains difficult as reciprocal processes of boundary drawing between
              &#8220;foreigners&#8221; and &#8220;locals&#8221; remain prominent. But, as Brah has
              argued, &#8220;it is quite possible to feel at home in a place and, yet, the
              experience of social exclusions may inhibit public proclamations of the place as
              home&#8221; (<xref id="ID22cc536f-add0-4157-8dce-0fd1f585709c" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID48510118-455a-4ada-abb3-114eb6dacc5b">1996, 193</xref>). Antonia thus
              emphasizes the idea of Shanghai as her home, while possibly also feeling the need to
              convince me during the interview because my questions often considered the high
              mobility of students. Antonia, however, has lived mostly in Shanghai, and
              distinguishes herself from other expatriate kids by repeatedly stating that she grew
              up in the metropolis.</p>

            </p>
            <p>As Andrea&#8217;s and Antonia&#8217;s positions show, everyday practices and the
              desire for routine as well as (long-term) processes of emplacement contribute to
              students&#8217; claiming Shanghai as their home, and prioritizing the city over other
              places in their spatial networks. Nevertheless, while many expatriate youths may feel
              at home in Shanghai, public proclamations of the place as home remain difficult for
              them.</p>

          <title>2.4. Concluding thoughts on home</title>
          <p>A rhizome may be broken, shattered at a given spot, but it will start up again on one
            of its old lines, or on new lines (<xref id="ID77bc56a9-7981-4529-a46e-abf01f1df867" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">Deleuze and Guattari
              1987, 9</xref>).</p>
          <p>As these students&#8217; narratives and practices have shown, home is not only anchored
            to a place, but also tied to people (relatives, friends, and classmates), emotions (such
            as &#8220;feeling safe&#8221;), objects (such as furniture, photographs, and books),
            sensory impressions (such as bakery smells), and practices (like a family dinner). As
            Walsh succinctly states, &#8220;The home is experienced simultaneously as both a
            material and immaterial, lived and imagined, localized and (trans)national space of
            belonging&#8221; (<xref id="ID07072b40-3eed-4e76-aaae-aae53fb30351" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0313e4ae-8f49-4ee9-9c74-5a6dd5670f02">Walsh 2006a, 123</xref>). Home is
            therefore not only a bifocal outlook on one&#8217;s &#8220;homeland&#8221; and
            &#8220;current home,&#8221; as former conceptualizations suggest (<xref id="ID33cac6f0-3d31-478e-a7aa-e5dc0266eb21" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID1990d32c-25ab-4eca-86dd-d07f03ba71a3">see summary by Vertovec 2004</xref>), but
            a multi-focal one, a network of homes. I believe that these diverse connections can be
            best understood as rhizomatic in the sense that Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (<xref id="ID29d6ddf2-d7c0-4288-b3a9-af34d2fc7965" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">1987</xref>) understand it. As noted
            earlier, unlike a tree or its root, &#8220;which plots a point, fixes an order&#8221;
              (<xref id="ID72cd5f97-7edf-407d-9f08-7273603f5469" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 7</xref>), the rhizome
            &#8220;connects any point to any other point,&#8221; even if it is not usually
            classified as having a comparable nature (<xref id="IDe0627aea-a29a-4f1b-8955-deeddbac40bc" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">ibid., 21</xref>). It is in the same
            manner that the rhizomatic home connects different people, practices, places, material
            goods, and feelings of belonging. My analysis of the students&#8217; rhizomatic home
            therefore identifies and maps the following aspects:</p>
          <p>First, concerning the localized and material space, the expatriate students themselves
            are actively involved in the creation of home. While they have difficulties claiming the
            communal spaces of the gated communities as home, they decorate their bedrooms and
            sometimes other domestic spaces or turn the house into home by initiating and taking
            part in family activities. In short, they transform the new site into a meaningful
            space. These home-making practices help them to not only claim the current place of
            residence as a kind of home, but also serve to identify places where they lived before
            as home. These different locations are often still closely connected. For example, I
            often witnessed that my informants&#8217; friends who used to live in Shanghai still
            came to visit, which helped to tie the new expat location to the old one. </p>
          <p>Second, the rhizomatic home is not a mere network of multiple postings; instead, former
            and current dwelling places usually coincide with the presence of the nuclear family. It
            can therefore be said that, regardless of how &#8220;uprooted&#8221; the
            teenagers&#8217; networks of multiple homes may seem, the underlying hegemonic idea of
            &#8220;home&#8221; as the nuclear family staying together prevails in the majority of
            cases. Sometimes, as in Kressi&#8217;s or Marco&#8217;s situation, having a large
            extended family can be important in the creation of the youth&#8217;s network of home.
            Melissa Butcher highlights the importance of transnational relationships for migrants as
            tools for demarcating identity and claiming a place of belonging:</p>
          <p>The shared meaning embedded in relationships reaffirmed the practices of identity
            associated with that place. [&#8230;] There is still an impulse to belong to a place
            that is marked by characteristics of familiarity and comfort, including elements of the
            national imagination. This is supported by the maintenance of particular relationships
            to confirm that this identity and its associated practices and values are shared and
            therefore of value (<xref id="ID87e9bc64-52f9-46c9-8791-57eba201562c" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDf82162f2-e3da-4783-bc95-b77c32808b81">Butcher 2009, 1369</xref>). </p>
          <p>Apart from the actual places where the students used to live, home is also understood
            as a feeling of connectedness and belonging. </p>
          <p>Third, regarding the imagined and immaterial aspects of the rhizomatic home, my
            discussions have shown that teenagers continuously negotiate belonging in relation to
            family members, peers, society, and many other factors, including material objects.
            While, for some students, mental images of home coincide with their parents&#8217; ideas
            or their nationality according to their passport, for others, the issue of belonging can
            become a matter of conflict. Some struggle to negotiate conflicting feelings such as the
            desire to claim Shanghai as their home while also feeling like they are seen as
            &#8220;an exotic animal&#8221; by Shanghai&#8217;s other citizens, as Antonia describes,
            or handling conflicts with parents who consider home a fixed and definite location
            elsewhere, as shown in the discussions between the siblings Emily and Jacob. The problem
            of defining an emotional space of belonging can also lay in experiences of exclusion due
            to physical differences, as Kressi noted, when explaining her difficulty being accepted
            as German, due to her Asian phenotype. To expatriate students, the idea of home is thus
            also rhizomatic because it is &#8220;always in the middle, between things&#8221; (<xref id="ID1f5bc053-2396-427a-8580-d8ee182a717f" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 25</xref>),
            and the concomitant feelings of belonging and positions of cultural identity often are
            as well.</p>
          <p>Finally, home can also be related to feelings of &#8220;missing.&#8221; Homelessness,
            as mentioned on all the students&#8217; posters, and homesickness, as described by
            Karina who misses Prague and her network there, or by Mia who misses practices like the
            family dinners she used to participate in, are thus also part of the overall
            &#8220;homing&#8221; process. </p>
          <p>Based on the idea of the rhizome, this chapter concludes that, for many expatriate
            youths, home is always multi-sited and constantly in progress, as well as negotiated in
            relation to others. These findings can be related to the concept of TCKs (Pollock and
            Van Reken [<xref id="IDb62e09fe-5302-423f-a19d-d4830324e329" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID5082239c-ace5-44bd-bee4-0a336c773304">1999</xref>] 2009) and to Franke&#8217;s
            (2008) study mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. However, the rhizomatic home is
            also tied to concrete sites, physical belongings, and practices. While privileged
            migrants might be used to a home in flux, place nevertheless holds an important role in
            their lives. One concept investigating migrants&#8217; mediating processes of belonging
            and the relationships they form between various spaces that fits the experiences of
            these expatriate youths better than the TCK concept is David Conradson and Deirdre
            McKay&#8217;s (2007) theory of &#8220;translocal subjectivities.&#8221; Conradson and
            McKay argue that mobility in particular &#8220;provides opportunities for new forms of
            subjectivity and emotion to emerge&#8221; (ibid., 168). In order to understand these
            emerging emotions and understandings of the self, the authors suggest adopting the
            concept of translocal subjectivities based on Appadurai&#8217;s (1996) notion of
            translocality. This concept aims &#8220;to describe the multiply-located senses of self
            amongst those who inhabit transnational social fields&#8221; (Conradson and Mckay 2007,
            168). The authors understand translocal subjectivities as &#8220;emerging through both
            geographical mobility and multiple forms of ongoing emplacement&#8221; (ibid.).
            Additionally, these translocal subjectivities are often based on migrants relating to
            specific localities, rather than nation states; thus their positioning, relationships,
            and experiences become more translocal than transnational (ibid., 169). Finally,
            Conradson and McKay maintain that translocal subjectivities are shaped by &#8220;the
            emotional and affective states accompanying mobility&#8221; (ibid.). All of these
            aspects describe the subjective experiences these expatriate youths provided in their
            narratives.</p>
          <p>Relating to the last aspect, the impact of emotions on these youths&#8217;
            relationships with their current residence can also be traced in their home-making
            practices, which can be seen as coping mechanisms. These behaviors, making and
            (re)imagining homes, and collecting belongings to produce a sense of belonging, help the
            youths deal with feelings of loneliness and enable them to let the rhizomatic home, to
            return to Deleuze and Guattari, &#8220;start up again&#8221; (<xref id="ID181ca5e3-9845-4196-81ba-37b0ab6fd09a" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDff9d31b9-9160-4b9c-b2ff-80db2d11fa06">Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 9</xref>). </p>
          <p>When it comes to coping with feeling uprooted, and the often conflicting feelings about
            home that this chapter discusses, children and youths tend to draw from the resources
            provided by their new school. It is in these schools that they receive further support,
            especially from their peers, to deal with such challenges. The following chapter
            explores the spaces of international schools and their role in the process of creating a
            community for students and their families. </p>

        <p>School is actually the most important thing here. During the week we spend our entire
          time here.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1866">23</xref> (Giovanni, seventeen years

        <p>With remarks similar to those of these three teenage boys, all of the students I
          interviewed confirmed the importance school played in offering them the opportunity to
          make friends and fight loneliness, while also offering a sense of continuity. School
          provides a space to establish a new social circle outside the family. Eleven-year-old
          Allen explains the role of the school in the following way:</p>
        <p>
          <speech id="s115">
            <speaker>Allen</speaker>
            <p>Depending upon what your everyday life is like, for instance, if you live near lots
              of Chinese people and you go to a private Chinese school, it makes a big impact. And
              then if you go to an international school, it makes the moving a lot easier. Because
              everyone there, they&#8217;re in the same, same space as everyone else around them,
              from moving from their home country to somewhere other than their home country. And
              also because of the communication, because it is easier to communicate than with a lot
              of Chinese people. </p>
          </speech>
        </p>
        <p>What is this experience that Allen describes as everyone being in &#8220;the same
          space?&#8221; What constitutes this space that schools provide, where, according to Allen,
          communication is easier and everyone feels unified by a common experience? This chapter
          attempts to answer these questions by examining the sites, values, practices, and
          students&#8217; experiences within international schools in Shanghai.</p>
        <p>The chapter begins with a description of the international schools in Shanghai and their
          common characteristics. Next, by describing a short movie that was produced by two
          students at a German school, I provide a detailed example of the efforts schools make to
          create a sense of community (at which they are the center). In the third section, I argue
          that these different school &#8220;communities&#8221; all see themselves as part of a
          larger unifying expatriate collective, where everyone is in the &#8220;same space.&#8221;
          I show how this &#8220;expatriateness&#8221; is learned, maintained, and performed along
          three aspects that were particularly prominent during my fieldwork: the common comfort
          lying in the norm of having a maid and a driver, the social concern cultivated through
          practices of charity, and the distinctions maintained through cosmopolitan cultural
          capital. Finally, I investigate the youths&#8217; own experiences of attending an
          international school in Shanghai by contending with two topics which dominate their
          narratives: privilege and pressure.</p>
        <sec>
          <title>3.1 Shanghai&#8217;s landscape of international schools</title>
          <p>The private international schools in Shanghai are places of central importance for
            expatriate youths. Upon analyzing these schools, not in terms of their academic
            curricula or achievements, but as particular places, they can be characterized by the
            five following attributes: their exclusion of Chinese students, the exclusion of foreign
            students without the financial means to meet high tuition fees, their geographical
            locations in the suburbs, their strict regulations and well-guarded gates, and their
            roles as expatriate community centers. I will expand on these points, and the last two
            aspects in particular, to illustrate the role of the school in (teenage) expatria.</p>
          <p>The first main characteristic of the international schools in Shanghai is that students
            with Chinese passports are excluded. International schools form a distinct sub-sector.
            Within this sector, schools can be divided into foreign-run schools and divisions of
            local schools. Both are targeted solely at foreign passport holders. Shanghai&#8217;s
            numerous international schools differ in their curricula, teaching language, type of
            diploma offered, student body nationalities admitted, and form of organization. Yamato
            and Bray (<xref id="ID9635f382-1407-4c74-8824-27025f4fb9d6" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe4eeeacf-fa84-4566-8306-e0b119376b55">2006, 79</xref>) found that &#8220;the
            English-medium schools were more international because they used a language that has
            wide portability.&#8221; This point is in keeping with my findings: at the French and
            German-medium schools, students represented considerably fewer nationalities than at
            their English counterparts. While Chinese government regulations prohibit local children
            of Chinese nationality from enrolling at any of these international schools (<xref id="ID761f229c-93c0-42d6-bf55-d80fc5f88d78" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe4eeeacf-fa84-4566-8306-e0b119376b55">Yamato and Bray 2006, 64</xref>), the
            Shanghai municipal authorities can grant exceptions to special cases. During my
            research, however, I only met one student who had been granted this permission.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1919">26</xref> The resulting absence of locals therefore
            seems to be a major difference between the international schools in Shanghai and those
            elsewhere&#8212;see Dobeneck&#8217;s (2010, 115&#8211;118) descriptions of German-medium
            schools in Sao Paulo, for example. </p>
          <p>International schools in Shanghai all charge tuition fees. This is also the case for
            schools that are run by non-profit agencies. Their tuition fees for the 2010&#8211;2011
            school year ranged from approximately RMB 88,500 to 240,000 (&#8364;9,735 to
            &#8364;26,400) per year at the high school level. In many cases, tuition costs are
            covered by the expatriate packages provided by the parents&#8217; employers. Some
            schools offer different fees for families paying through private means. However, the
            second main characteristic of the international schools in Shanghai is that they exclude
            students whose parents cannot afford the tuition fees.</p>
          <p>Yamato and Bray found that the schools they studied, and the English-medium schools
              (<xref id="IDac0e0bb9-9a71-4f8e-8d33-7d0ddc103466" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe4eeeacf-fa84-4566-8306-e0b119376b55">2006, 59</xref>;79) in particular, were
            in competition with each other. In consequence, they try to find their own niches,
            sometimes also through location: &#8220;Schools can increase their market shares by
            securing premises in the suburbs in which their potential clients are
            concentrated&#8221; (ibid. <xref id="ID48915f72-0a59-460f-ab47-4bd7931162a2" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe4eeeacf-fa84-4566-8306-e0b119376b55">2006, 59</xref>). The
            choice of school and the choice of housing area are therefore connected. Thus a third
            main characteristic of the international schools is their location on the outskirts of
            the city, in the vicinity of the spacious gated communities described in the previous
            chapter. </p>
          <p>Finally, international schools are highly regulated and sealed-off spaces. It is not
            surprising that human geographers of youth stress that the space of the school is
            under-researched (<xref id="IDe38c50af-122d-486b-9021-a9944e4ec56e" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID97eeb30a-dbb3-4161-a113-93d6ad803040">Valentine 2003, 42</xref>). Studies
            involving minors and closed institutions are complicated by difficulties of access. Many
            of my own email inquiries remained unanswered, even though I included letters of
            references, research outlines, my r&#233;sum&#233;, and other information. Whenever I
            had opportunities to meet principals in person, they were usually in favor of my
            research project, although the disruption of school activities and regular classes was a
            concern. Some schools, like a British international school located in Pudong, supported
            the project by contacting students and parents and letting me conduct interviews with
            them on the school&#8217;s premises. A German school&#8217;s staff was even so kind as
            to let me sit in on certain classes. A Singaporean school principal and teacher were
            also supportive and found a solution that included me teaching a Theory of Knowledge
            class and allowed me to conduct interviews. An American middle school&#8217;s counselor
            allowed me to see the school facilities and meet teachers at a career development day
            for staff. Interviews with students, however, were denied as the school objected to the
            perceived organizational effort that would be required. The only other personal contact
            I had was with the principals of another American international school. Here, although
            one language teacher and six of her students were eager to participate, the school
            management objected. We had to cancel the interviews despite students&#8217;,
            parents&#8217;, and teachers&#8217; agreements. However, I learned much about the same
            school by visiting one elementary class in another capacity. Although another British
            school never replied to my inquiries, I had the opportunity to see their campus during a
            volunteer activity. For the students from a French school and an American Christian
            school, the path was different, as their friends whom I had interviewed earlier
            introduced me to them. I conducted these interviews outside of school and thus without
            any discussions with the schools&#8217; management. As the German and French schools I
            visited are on the same campus, I had the opportunity to acquaint myself with the French
            school&#8217;s setting. I did not have the opportunity to see the campus of the American
            Christian school, though. I also contacted numerous other schools, from which I never
            received an answer or which I simply could not include for consideration, due to
            constraints in time and resources.</p>
          <p>All of the schools are located on the outskirts of the city and have fenced-off
            campuses with regulated access to their spaces. At every school I visited, I had to get
            a visitor&#8217;s pass before being allowed to enter, which I then had to wear around my
            neck for the day. Policies varied from providing your name, phone number, and the name
            of the person to be visited, to requiring identity checks and body temperature controls
            for health reasons. Some of the schools, such as an American school I visited in Pudong,
            even have a second wall around them because they are located within gated communities.
            The following image, which depicts this gated community, is included to give an
            impression of international schools&#8217; surroundings (Figure 14). However, as the
            security guards in front of the school prohibited me from taking photos of the school
            itself, and in order to keep institutions anonymous, I cannot show specific
            buildings.</p>
          <p>These experiences of efforts to regulate access are, of course, less obvious to
            students than they are to a researcher or outsider. However, schools with their dress
            codes (some schools require uniforms), schedules, and scheduled breaks are
            well-regulated spaces for the students as well. Students from the German and French
            campus have to enter and exit the school premises through doors equipped with card
            readers. Only the upper-grade students can exit these during the school day. However,
            sometimes students sneak around these, risking the punishment of having to work in the
            cafeteria.</p>
          <p>The fifth aspect of international schools in Shanghai is their role as community hubs.
            Students&#8217; lives obviously revolve around their schools as places of education,
            friendship, and after-school activities such as sports or artistic hobbies. However, in
            many cases, the international schools in Shanghai seem to be not only central to the
            children, to for the adult expatriate community as well. It is not surprising that a
            popular parental guidebook for expatriates strongly advises parents to become active at
            the school:</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to stress again the importance of getting involved with your
            child&#8217;s new school in an overseas setting. Not only will your child find this a
            positive sign of your interest in them, but your involvement in the school community is
            a wonderful way to help create a new &#8220;extended family&#8221; for celebrating
            holidays far from home, traveling within the country, or just getting together with
            other parents to compare notes on the weekend. If you stayed away from parents&#8217;
            organizations before you moved abroad (and let other parents handle all the volunteer
            work that enhanced your child&#8217;s life), now&#8217;s your chance to repay that debt
              (<xref id="ID0a2284a5-e551-41be-84ca-76f2d05d8cbf" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID861975ad-65b4-4156-a389-88f79d162ce7">Pascoe 2006, 142</xref>).</p>
          <p>Many schools offer social activities where parents can meet, or cultural activities
            that everyone (or at least everyone associated with the school) can participate in. Some
            schools are more ethnically focused in their activities and networks than others, but
            all have parents&#8217; organizations and provide cultural activities, such as plays,
            dances, bazaars, sporting events, or orientations. Schools also sell branded items such
            as yearbooks, T-shirts, or school bags. Fiona Moore (<xref id="ID90b97109-0f52-4d1c-a039-879f446492c8" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID75c544d3-dc61-488e-8bdf-9753c533a7dc">2008</xref>), who examined the German
            school in London (Deutsche Schule London, abbreviated here as &#8220;DSL&#8221;) from an
            adult perspective, found that it serves a central role for the German community.
            &#8220;One of the DSL&#8217;s explicit functions is a site for the adjustment and
            development of networks of the spouses of expatriates, with a particular focus on female
            spouses&#8221; (<xref id="IDd5f9b9ed-5d4a-4368-bd31-bb39825148b3" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID75c544d3-dc61-488e-8bdf-9753c533a7dc">Moore 2008, 94</xref>). She furthermore
            argues that this important connection in the network for German expatriates in London
            &#8220;not only educates the children, but also provides a forum for the expression of
            Germanness&#8221; (<xref id="ID532f6664-15e5-4b17-a056-e9438e774593" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID75c544d3-dc61-488e-8bdf-9753c533a7dc">Moore 2008, 91</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1965">27</xref> The international schools in Shanghai
            obviously create similar important ties within the expatriate network, solidifying its
            role as what Simon Turner described as a &#8220;safe haven:&#8221;</p>
          <p>However, mobility does hold the potential for creating liminality: a space of
            indeterminacy where established structures are put out of function. It is in these
            situations of indeterminate meaning that some institutions&#8212;such as the
            family&#8212;are put under pressure and forced to change [&#8230;] while
            others&#8212;like some religious and political movements&#8212;seem to flourish, lending
            themselves to the creation of new identities while guaranteeing some stability.
            Appealing to the anxieties of mobility, such institutions may provide safe havens while
            being immensely transnational themselves (<xref id="ID63cb8968-3cb6-4eb8-b9b7-8597a5263fa4" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID0b26853c-7600-4e55-a3db-44d1eda292c8">Turner 2008, 1052</xref>).</p>
          <p>While schools seem attractive when presented as such &#8220;safe havens,&#8221; their
            exclusionary practices also have to be kept in mind&#8212;an aspect that this metaphor
            problematically conceals. As major nodes in the expatriate networks, schools have a
            strong influence on the expatriate way of life. The British school I visited, for
            example, provides a &#8220;Shanghai resident map&#8221; that, in addition to the school
            campuses, includes the location of compounds, foreign-run medical centers, churches,
            shopping locations, spas, cinemas, and restaurants that have become favorites among
            expats. The German school provides lists of popular residential compounds online. While
            some school communities, such as the German school, are strongly tied to national
            communities, they all, however, see themselves as part of the larger expatriate
            community. The expatriate experience is a unifying framework based on the construction
            of a shared concept of expatriate identity that transcends the national, cultural and
            ethnic differences among the various expatriate communities in Shanghai. In the
            following section, I provide a key example of the schools&#8217; pivotal and
            well-guarded role at the core of the larger expatriate network in Shanghai, by zooming
            in on the German school, the site of the largest portion of my research.</p>

          <title>3.2. Image and community</title>
          <p>The international schools actively support processes of national as well as
            international expatriate community building through various means and see themselves as
            major centers in Shanghai&#8217;s expatriate communities. One project, produced by two
            students at the German school, exemplifies the efforts such schools make to encourage
            the idea that communities revolve around them. The project, a short video produced by
            the student Kressi and one of her friends, was made to be shown at an awards ceremony in
              Berlin.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e1982">28</xref> The roughly five minute video
            opens with an image of the school&#8217;s logo and motto, followed by a black screen,
            and the announcement &#8220;pr&#228;sentiert&#8221; (presents). The next sequence shows
            impressions filmed out of a moving car. The color of the vehicle and the driver&#8217;s
            taxi license reveal what locals would recognize as a typical Shanghai taxi. A title then
            fades in to announce what the clip presents, &#8220;My Time is Now: Das
            Zeitprojekt&#8221; (The Time Project), a reference to an art project for which the
            school won a prize, as is further introduced in the next caption: &#8220;Kinder
            zum-Olymp!&#8212;Sonderpreis-Gewinner 2011&#8221; (Children to Olympus&#8212;Award
            Winner 2011). These images and texts are accompanied by melodic whistling, the beginning
            of the song &#8220;Home,&#8221; by Edward Sharpe &amp; The Magnetic Zeros. When the
            lyrics start, &#8220;Alabama, Arkansas, I do love my ma and pa,&#8221; the taxi ride
            changes to blurry images zooming in on Shanghai&#8217;s Bund and a Chinese flag, while a
            caption in white letters introduces &#8220;Shanghai, China, &#19978;&#28023;.&#8221;
            Despite being targeted at a German audience, the Chinese characters are included in the
            caption, presumably to emphasize the school&#8217;s special or even &#8220;exotic&#8221;
            location. The words then make room for images. The flag and buildings become
            increasingly clearer. The viewer realizes that the camera is zooming in on the Bund with
            its iconic buildings. While the Bund is still a blurred image, we read &#8220;21
            Millionen Einwohner&#8221; (21 million inhabitants), which then fades and reveals the
            full, now-focused image of the new Pudong side of the Bund. A photo of overpasses and
            traffic signs, with high-rise buildings in the background, follows. Inserted text which
            appears and fades out again simply reads: &#8220;modern&#8221; (Figure 15).</p>
          <p>The subsequent shot shows a temple yard with people burning incense; the caption now
            reads &#8220;traditionell zugleich&#8221; (traditional at the same time). Images of the
            old lane houses in Taikang Road are next, blending into a picture of metro signs and
            then again of high-rise buildings with the caption: &#8220;dynamische
            Wirtschaftsmetropole&#8221; (dynamic commercial metropolis). The white letters fade, the
            skyscrapers become sharp and then quickly dissolve into numerous squares that turn
            around to reveal an image of the school building. While the school building appears,
            blurs, and comes into focus again, letters boldly announce: &#8220;Zuhause&#8221;
            (Home)&#8212;(Figure 16a).</p>
          <p>This image is followed by recordings of students entering and leaving school, played in
            fast-forward, with a new text line appearing, continuing the message from the last
            image: &#8220;F&#252;r 1230 Sch&#252;ler an zwei Schulstandorten&#8221; (For 1230
            students on two campuses). We then, still in fast mode, enter the school premises, while
            the song continues: &#8220;Home, home, home, is wherever I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;
            (Figure 16b).</p>
          <p>Inside the school, we can observe, for a few quick moments in fast-forward mode, the
            daily business of students running around and parents picking up their children. Then a
            series of photographs follows, introducing the viewer to numerous school projects and
            events, such as music workshops, concerts, art projects (I will further explore one such
            project by the student Andrea in Part IV, Chapter 1), yearbook awards, theater, and the
            graduation ceremony (Figure 16c).</p>
          <p>Four of the almost five minutes of the video present numerous activities, but do not
            offer any insights into the daily routines or regular classroom interactions that shape
            everyday life at school. Here, the school is presented as an active, arts-oriented,
            lively community, not only depicting numerous projects and students, but also different
            audiences at the events. At the end, the video clip takes us back to the Bund, this time
            at night. The city of Shanghai, depicted in the beginning and at the end, thus frames
            the images of the school, staging the campus&#8212;which could be anywhere&#8212;as
            international. These last shots are then headed with captions that bid the viewer
            &#8220;Good bye!&#8221; in Chinese and &#8220;Greetings from Shanghai&#8221; in German,
            to then finally return to the school&#8217;s logo and motto from the very beginning
            (Figure 16d).</p>
          <p>In the video, the institution is staged as a lively community framed by recognizable,
            even clich&#233;d images of Shanghai. When talking with student Kressi about the
            production of the video, it becomes clear that it was filmed with the intention of
            representing the school&#8217;s art class on the one hand, and the school as a whole on
            the other.</p>
          <p>Kressi and her friend were happy to shoot the movie on behalf of the school because she
            enjoys being creative, but also because it enabled her and her friend to get the chance
            to spend a weekend in Berlin. The movie therefore is not only a creative project by two
            teenage girls, but also a public relations product that was requested by the school,
            which in turn funded their trip to Europe. However, while the school decided which
            events and art and music projects were to be depicted, it was the two girls who chose to
            accompany the images with the song. When I asked her about the choice of music, Kressi
            explained:</p>
          <p>For Kressi, school life is tied to her friends, and these friendships and connections
            create a feeling (in the words of the song) of home. The people, everyday practices, and
            ideals presented in the video produce, in a reciprocal process, the image of the school
            as being central to the community.</p>
          <p>In this process, the school&#8217;s material culture also plays a role. Gerd Baumann
            and Thijl Sunier (<xref id="IDe4143239-42ba-4d40-bd87-18dd9fa1dd49" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDd3962487-4e1a-4cf6-ae5c-8217568fb94b">2002, 34&#8211;36</xref>), in their
            detailed description and comparison of four different comprehensive schools in Paris,
            London, Berlin, and Rotterdam, see different national ideas of citizenship reflected in
            the ways the school premises are decorated and managed; the school gates in particular
            are seen as symbolic of the attitudes and practices each nation espouses, along with
            that nation&#8217;s ideas of how to manage ethnic diversity and political engagement.
            David MacDougall&#8217;s (<xref id="IDee4fda33-e915-425a-8274-6b8e8202ff4f" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">2006</xref>) concept of
            social aesthetics, which I presented in the Introduction and now expand upon, emphasizes
            how this specific material culture&#8212;a school&#8217;s premises, the equipment, and
            the regulations revolving around it&#8212;affects the students engaging with that
            environment on a daily basis. With the term &#8220;social aesthetics,&#8221; he
            describes &#8220;the creation of an aesthetic space or sensory structure&#8221; (<xref id="ID791a09c7-716a-4019-b36f-7927fd106e6e" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">2006, 105</xref>). Aesthetics here do not
            mean notions of beauty or art, but a &#8220;wider range of culturally patterned sensory
            experience&#8221; (<xref id="ID56c569f7-67f9-42da-b057-1b91dc953018" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">ibid., 98</xref>). MacDougall understands
            the social aesthetic field as a coalescence of different elements such as &#8220;objects
            and actions.&#8221; Analyzing the social aesthetic field therefore means focusing on a
            specific community and its landscape&#8212;its material environment as well as the day
            to day practices taking place in that environment. MacDougall suggests, based on his
            work on the prestigious Doon School in India, that societies &#8220;may find in the
            sharing of a strong aesthetic experience a unifying principle&#8221; (<xref id="ID7684b9c7-bde3-409a-91f6-23c3308b5287" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">ibid., 99</xref>). The social aesthetics
            in the spaces of the German international schools therefore can also be seen as serving
            to create the students&#8217; sense of belonging. MacDougall suggests paying attention
            to specific objects in relation to daily practices: &#8220;The social aesthetic field is
            never mutual or random: its patterning creates forces and polarities with strong
            emotional effects. Ordinary objects with which one comes in daily contact take on a
            particular aura, and this aura is augmented by repetition and multiplication&#8221;
              (<xref id="IDef3c36ed-5dc0-4cc6-bef9-fe5ba42375dc" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">MacDougall 2006, 111</xref>).</p>
          <p>While this aura of repetition is not present in the video described here, which focuses
            primarily on community events, it is omnipresent in the everyday school experience of
            expat youths. This aura of repetition is, for instance, evoked by the routine of passing
            through the school gates with student IDs in the morning, seeking out one&#8217;s place
            in the rarely changing seating arrangement in the classrooms, or waiting for the
            teachers. Specific structures further shape the social aesthetics, whether they be the
            precisely measured units of lessons and breaks, the rules of where and when to eat, the
            decision about who is allowed to take the elevator and who must take the stairs&#8212;a
            major issue at the Singaporean school I visited&#8212;or the regulations about leaving
            the premises. These routines provide the students with a sense of community. It is
            therefore not surprising that, only after comprehending all these rules&#8212;which were
            somehow self-evident to the students&#8212;I began to feel comfortable at the school
            myself (see my descriptions of a day at the German school in Part I, Chapter 2). </p>
          <p>The school events (such as those presented in the students&#8217; PR film) help the
            school present itself as a true community by including parents and other (German)
            adults. I myself, for instance, gained access to the German school through such an
            event. Fiona Moore, in her article on the German school in London, shows that the
            network revolving around the school actively aims for the creation of a new generation
            of young German transnational actors, for example through providing students with
            internships at prestigious institutions (<xref id="ID2547e6cd-ebae-4e05-9b5b-50e6f2f01959" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID75c544d3-dc61-488e-8bdf-9753c533a7dc">Moore 2008, 97</xref>). A sensitive look
            at the role of Shanghai&#8217;s international schools reveals that they not only play a
            key role in creating a home or community for the students, but also promote general
            identification with other international expatriates. In other words, schools become
            powerful institutions for both educating and fostering a national or school community
            and shaping forms of belonging by unifying expatriates.</p>

          <title>3.3. Learning and living &#8220;expatriateness&#8221;</title>
          <p>The sense of an expatriate community is produced through various means under the strong
            influence of international schools. The creation of and belonging to expatria can be
            seen as diasporic forms of community creation and simultaneously understood as a class
            or habitus consciousness, rendered visible through everyday (material) practices,
            identity performances, and the accumulation of cultural capital. Before drawing on three
            cases from my fieldwork to support these arguments, I will briefly discuss the role of
            education in forming a community, class, or habitus and explain my choice of the term
            &#8220;expatriateness.&#8221;</p>
          <p>Johanna Waters, drawing on Butler (2003), argues that &#8220;education is inextricably
            linked to the existence and recreation of a middle-class habitus that includes a closely
            guarded sub-culture of &#8216;community&#8217;&#8221; (Waters 2007, 480). In her
            article, &#8220;&#8216;Roundabout Routes and Sanctuary Schools:&#8217; The Role of
            Situated Educational Practices and Habitus in the Creation of Transnational
            Professionals,&#8221; Waters (2007) examines the formation of transnational
            professionals in Hong Kong. Since children&#8217;s education has been cited as a major
            reason for internationally-educated locals to leave Hong Kong, her study focuses
            particularly on the role of international education and the complex familial strategies
            centered on it. Her case studies in Hong Kong and Vancouver suggest &#8220;the active
            creation of group boundaries and the cultivation and inculcation of an exclusive
            identity through segregation and similar education and migration experiences&#8221;
            (Waters 2007, 492). Waters&#8217; description of the creation of group boundaries
            provides a very different reading of the phenomenon that Pollock and Van Reken ([<xref id="ID9ddbef94-dd7b-4e09-b007-bf1d60d177cf" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID5082239c-ace5-44bd-bee4-0a336c773304">1999</xref>] 2009) present in their
            literature on TCKs, which sees the formation of these boundaries as a positive
            experience of healing and belonging for mobile youths. Education and habitus among the
            internationally-educated locals Waters studied in Hong Kong therefore create a group
            that is both spatially and socially distinct. While international schools and overseas
            schooling &#8220;is clearly the preserve of the wealthy and privileged,&#8221; Waters
            also argues that &#8220;it is often used as a means of avoiding failure in the local
            (and far more &#8216;challenging&#8217; and competitive) system.&#8221; Waters concludes
            that education &#8220;plays a pivotal role in the creation of an exclusive and elite
            group identity&#8221; and that this distinctive group identity is &#8220;rewarded in the
            labour market&#8221; (Waters 2007, 494). German sociologist Michael Hartmann&#8217;s
            research on social origin and educational trajectories among the business elite in
            Germany and France (Hartmann 2000) similarly found that a class-specific habitus is
            decisive&#8212;in a direct sense in Germany and, indirectly, through attending elite
            universities in France&#8212;for an individual&#8217;s career. He argues that &#8220;it
            is a class-specific habitus that ensures the high stability of social recruitment&#8221;
            and that it &#8220;can forge a sufficient internal bond even without such an
            institutionalization of &#8216;cultural capital&#8217; in education&#8221; (Hartmann
            2000, 258).</p>
          <p>The significance of a distinctive habitus in the creation of an exclusive class or
            community of transnational professionals is evident in my research in Shanghai as well.
            I argue that, just like the group of transnational professionals Waters (<xref id="IDdfe1e11a-b2ef-44ce-8e09-a1edf2e7c0dc" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID70e12c67-9b16-4e7b-909d-c010a302233f">2007</xref>) studies in Hong Kong, the
            international education of expatriate offspring plays a major role in forging bonds and
            creating an exclusive group identity. The opportunity to attend an international school
            is an argument for the move, as well as the pride and status many families gain from the
            experience. A German mother of three children (ages seven to fourteen) whom I
            interviewed during my earlier fieldwork in 2007, for instance, explained how the option
            for international schooling influenced her decision to move to Malaysia and later
            Shanghai:</p>
          <p>The young actors of my study, all in the process of receiving their formal education,
            are acquiring this distinctive habitus, best labeled as &#8220;expatriate,&#8221;
            drawing from their education and different networks and contributing to their
            family&#8217;s sense of belonging in the community.</p>
          <p>I use the term &#8220;expatriate&#8221; here to refer simply to a network of mobile
            professionals and their families. Most expatriates might simply be (and see themselves
            as) &#8220;middle class&#8221; in their home countries. At first sight, Conradson and
            Latham&#8217;s term &#8220;&#8216;middling&#8217; forms of transnationalism&#8221; (</p>
          <p>What is striking about many of the people involved in these kinds of transnational
            travels is their middling status position in their countries of origin. They are often,
            but not always, well educated. They may come from wealthy families, but more often than
            not they appear to be simply middle class. In terms of the societies they come from and
            those they are travelling to, they are very much of the middle (<xref id="ID14c3e734-d621-4cdb-99fe-0211fdf6272d" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDafb86d5f-eea1-4435-afa3-27427874c73e">Conradson and Latham 2005,
            228</xref>).</p>
          <p>I can easily identify with and categorize my own movement according to Conradson and
            Latham&#8217;s understanding of &#8220;&#8216;middling&#8217; forms of
            transnationalism.&#8221; However, there seems to be a difference between the expatriate
            families mentioned above and those whom I studied in Shanghai. While most of these
            families might be middle class &#8220;in terms of the societies they come from,&#8221;
            they are certainly not middle class in China, where &#8220;they are travelling
            to.&#8221; Their new lifestyle includes the service of maids and drivers, private
            schooling, regular international travel, and vacations. Their financial status is not
            comparable to that of the Chinese middle class.</p>
          <p>The term &#8220;elite,&#8221; nevertheless, proves difficult as well. I am hesitant to
            apply it to my research group because it is &#8220;a term of reference, rather than
            self-reference,&#8221; as George Marcus (<xref id="IDb86f1775-d0fb-4b86-8a26-d750c4764361" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDa1a89867-ed71-41db-842e-96a0e6adf157">1983a, 9</xref>) has pointed out.
            Furthermore, the term &#8220;elite&#8221; is unsuitable for my research perspective due
            to its associated research tradition.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2102">29</xref> My
            focus on expatriate youths&#8217; voices, which allows for the in-depth analysis of
            age-specific and subjective experiences of transnational migration, cannot
            simultaneously center on the &#8220;nature of the larger system in which it is
            meaningful to label them as elites&#8221; (<xref id="ID80b9a04f-5739-4c53-aed9-d8181fe4e144" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDa1a89867-ed71-41db-842e-96a0e6adf157">Marcus 1983a, 13</xref>). Therefore, I
            find the term &#8220;elite&#8221; misleading for my analysis of the processes of
            community building, status, habitus, and class in the realm of the students&#8217;
            schools and their environment. These entangled negotiations of a community/habitus/class
            shall therefore, instead, be described as practicing &#8220;expatriateness.&#8221; </p>
          <p>The expatriate community in Shanghai is diverse in many ways and maintains inner
            divisions of class, ethnicity, and nationality. It consists of its many specific groups
            revolving around certain clubs<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2122">30</xref>&#8212;which
            are often tied to nationality&#8212;institutions, companies, neighborhoods, and other
            organizations. Here, the international schools play a lead role. People connected to the
            German School, for instance, despite their differences, consider themselves a group, as
            one small community in expatria. Most youths and their families would, at the same time,
            also see a larger expatriate network as existing in Shanghai and, for example, by
            labeling various places they frequent as &#8220;expatriate,&#8221; consider themselves
            part of Shanghai&#8217;s overall expatriate community.</p>
          <p>The making of this expatriate community can be viewed in the same way that
            anthropologist Cris Shore (<xref id="ID01c24247-21d5-4e42-8db7-1600f9370ec1" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID50609c0f-64ba-404c-815e-8d7d8fa814ae">2002</xref>) discusses
            the making of elites, drawing on Bourdieu&#8217;s (<xref id="ID0c461e9e-e950-433f-93b1-3d484b267650" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID85e3d2be-c58a-4766-abf6-28fae2d7efb8">1984</xref>) notion of distinction:
            &#8220;in order to constitute itself as an elite in the first place an elite group must
            develop its own particularistic set of interests, norms and practices to differentiate
            itself from the masses. It must achieve &#8216;distinction&#8217;&#8221; (Shore <xref id="ID8b634bf2-c1fa-40d6-a62c-8dc54c98cdea" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID50609c0f-64ba-404c-815e-8d7d8fa814ae">2002</xref>, 2&#8211;3).</p>
          <p>Regarding the distinction of elite groups, Shore sees the question of &#8220;how they
            do this&#8221; and the examination of the &#8220;cultural resources they mobilise and
            the way they cultivate functions&#8221; as important issues for anthropology (<xref id="IDe7612aa0-d89b-4437-9770-aeddcb2035d9" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID50609c0f-64ba-404c-815e-8d7d8fa814ae">ibid., 3</xref>). In order to understand
            how expatriate youths learn &#8220;expatriateness,&#8221; I investigated spatial
            practices and other forms of everyday activities that serve to create a distinct
            collective expatriate identity. Exclusion and inclusion along ethnic lines also play a
            major role, as exemplified by the experience German student Don, who is of Chinese
            descent, shared (see Part III, Chapter 1) regarding his treatment by entrance guards at
            his friends&#8217; compounds. Undeniably, whiteness is one of the strongest markers for
            &#8220;expatriateness&#8221; (see also Part IV, Chapter 4).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e2136">31</xref> However, there are many subtle practices of creating and
            maintaining &#8220;expatriateness,&#8221; be it through sharing educational values or
            through creating demarcations from not only those &#8220;back home&#8221; but also from
            the local Shanghainese. I will use three examples that were particularly relevant during
            my fieldwork to tease out how &#8220;expatriateness&#8221; is performed, maintained, and
            taught among expatriate youths: first, the convenience associated with the norm of
            having a maid and a driver, second, the social concern cultivated through practices of
            charity and social outreach work, and third, the distinctions maintained through their
            cosmopolitan cultural capital.</p>

          <title>Example 1: Everyday Comforts</title>
          <p>Antonia, who grew up in Shanghai, recognizes the privileged ways of life Shanghai
            offers expatriate youths on one hand but, on the other hand, does not associate having
            staff at home with privilege or luxury; she sees these circumstances as quotidian, as an
            ordinary part of life. Her double perspective, maybe triggered by my presence as a
            researcher, reminds me of Conradson and Latham&#8217;s call to consider aspects of the
            ordinary underlying transnational mobility:</p>
          <p>Viewed from this quotidian angle, even the most hyper-mobile transnational elites are
            ordinary: they eat; they sleep; they have families who must be raised, educated and
            taught a set of values. They have friends to keep up with and relatives to honour. While
            such lives may be stressful and involve significant levels of dislocation, for those in
            the midst of these patterns of activity, this effort is arguably simply part of the
            taken-for-granted texture of daily existence (<xref id="ID6846dc9b-6353-4971-831f-d1d8cab49564" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDafb86d5f-eea1-4435-afa3-27427874c73e">Conradson and Latham 2005,
            228</xref>).</p>
          <p>This ordinary comfort is usually put in perspective in comparison to life in the
            (parents&#8217;) home countries. Giovanni, after his return from a summer holiday
            &#8220;at home&#8221; in Switzerland, for instance, replies to my inquiries about his
            experience of coming back to Shanghai by stressing the comfortable life Shanghai
            provides.</p>
          <p>His fellow student Andrea, during a follow-up interview around the same time, reflects
            in a similar way about her stay in Germany and her return to Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Marco, during a group interview with Peter in May 201 1, comments on the high financial
            standing of expatriate families by comparing the mobile phones belonging to students at
            his former school with those of his school in Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Marco&#8217;s comment directly addresses the privileged financial status that the expat
            community shares and how this can be seen in expat students&#8217; material culture, not
            only in their homes, but also at school. Housekeepers, drivers, and expensive electronic
            equipment make the financial privileges of expatriate life more visible and become the
            norm of a lifestyle that is associated with &#8220;luxury&#8221; or&#8212;in everyday
            practices&#8212;with &#8220;comfort.&#8221; Marco, recalling how, in the beginning, he
            had objections to move abroad, states that he does not regret moving to Shanghai.</p>
          <p>Bjorn, only about six months after his move to Shanghai, in a group discussion with Don
            and Alex, admits that he sometimes feels uncomfortable with the expatriate
            lifestyle.</p>

            <title>Example 2: Cultivating Concern</title>
            <p>The previous section shows that a certain amount of material wealth and displays of
              class status contribute to the meaning of &#8220;expatriateness,&#8221; a meaning that
              will dissolve if certain activities are not repeatedly performed and valued.
              &#8220;Expatriateness&#8221; is, therefore, also a performance (<xref id="IDbb2ba6ba-b451-47f1-8a4b-b1433391b3bf" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID6d664e13-6ee9-44db-99e8-020732223bf9">Goffman 1963</xref>) and one practice
              contributing to it is charity work. In September 2010, very early in my fieldwork, I
              consulted different websites providing help for expatriates living in Shanghai. I
              registered for an event called Interkom CityServe that was directed at teenagers.
              Interkom is a youth program at the Community Center Shanghai that offers various
              courses and activities for the expatriate community. At this event, different outreach
              organizations were presenting their work at the community center in the Jingqiao
              district and teenagers had the opportunity to contact these organizations in person
              and get involved in social outreach work in Shanghai. While initially impressed by the
              high turnout, I later learned, in conversations with students, that community work is
              part of the mandatory curriculum if you pursue an IB (International Baccalaureate).
              Social outreach work is thus a requirement for all students at many international
              schools.</p>
            <p>I also registered for a so-called &#8220;sorting party&#8221; organized by the social
              outreach organization Rivers of Hearts, in October 20</p>
            <p>Although social outreach work was not mandatory at the German school that I focused
              on, the role of charity had also become an integral part of their community. When a
              devastating earthquake hit Japan in the spring of 201 1, for instance, the older
              students organized a bake sale to collect money (Figure 18).</p>
            <p>While observing the older students selling and the younger students buying the
              home-made cake&#8212;mostly baked by mothers&#8212;during breaks at school, I learned
              that the school principal himself had encouraged students to organize such an event.
              Such involvement on the highest administrator&#8217;s part underlines the central role
              of the school in communicating the importance of and fostering engagement with social
              outreach work. Cultivating concern for the social and ecological problems of
              today&#8217;s world is, therefore, not only part of schools&#8217; lesson plans; this
              concern is also expressed through charity work that simultaneously reaffirms
              collective expatriate identities as compassionate donors and managers of global
              problems. It is this claiming of a global outlook that particularly unites and fosters
              the expatriate community.</p>

            <title>Example 3: Convenient Cosmopolitanism</title>
            <p>When visiting international schools, I could not help noticing their preference for
              decorating school buildings with various national flags. Indeed, it was often these
              flags that enabled me recognize the school building at first sight (Figure 19).</p>
            <p>As the first and fourth image above show, the schools display flags, often
              representing all the nationalities of their enrolled students, not only outside, but
              also inside to decorate corridors. These banners are an element of the &#8220;social
              aesthetics&#8221; (<xref id="IDa64e33e7-ccd6-4c9d-a2a3-a2ef696e6b2e" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">MacDougall 2006</xref>) of all
              international schools. The pride taken in the internationality of a school community,
              rendered visible for every student and visitor by these flags, is also mirrored in the
              students&#8217; narratives of international school life. When, during an interview in
              June 2012 (just after graduation), Kressi commented, as I had heard so often, on the
              internationality and diversity of her classmates, I suggested, in an attempt to be a
              bit provocative, that the German school might not even be considered very
              international, as most of the students who attended it were German. Kressi, however,
              insisted that it was, explaining:</p>
            <p>Kressi&#8217;s description of the different &#8220;perspectives,&#8221;
              &#8220;stories,&#8221; and &#8220;experiences&#8221; students share due to the
              &#8220;cultures in which the people have lived,&#8221; illustrates how she sees
              classmates as not simply being tied to one culture, but as individuals whose practices
              and cultural identities are shaped by a plurality that relates to the ideas of
              transculturation and the gaining of transcultural perspectives that I discussed in the
              Introduction. In the realm of school and education, however, I think students&#8217;
              experiences of processes of transculturation, of experiencing different places as
              crucial for &#8220;what defines them,&#8221; can also be conceptualized as what German
              ethnographer Jana Binder defines as &#8220;globality&#8221; (<xref id="IDa2142fdb-f528-4941-81fe-ad62e503d701" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe261f7d7-1d16-44b5-92c5-93cddc109941">Binder 2005</xref>). Binder interprets
              and summarizes backpackers&#8217; travel experiences in Asia and convincingly argues
              that long-term travelers develop their narratives of the trip along with their
              competence dealing with the challenges of a globalizing world. She calls these
              experiences and their representations&#8212;such as being in a certain place,
              experiencing oneself in a different environment, meeting people of other
              nationalities, or changing one&#8217;s lifestyle&#8212;&#8220;globality.&#8221; She
              further argues that this &#8220;globality&#8221; should be understood as a cultural
              resource in the Bourdieusian sense, as capital. Using the example of young
              backpackers, Binder shows how knowledge of contemporary processes of change and their
              associated discourses are turned into cultural capital and can be used advantageously
                (<xref id="ID943b64c4-907d-4da6-a50e-f6e9f57e09ce" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe261f7d7-1d16-44b5-92c5-93cddc109941">ibid., 215</xref>). Applying this

              teenagers and their career prospects brings similar views to the fore. Accumulating
              experiences of different places is seen, by expatriate teenagers and their parents, as
              a symbol of status and competence. Luke Desforges (<xref id="ID071ae683-16d9-40c6-b6ae-e77debc34b23" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDe0957c10-0750-491d-a45d-351cccbaa6d8">1998</xref>), who explores the ways in
              which British middle-class youths negotiate and build their identities through travel,
              claims (not unlike Binder) that young people convert the cultural capital they gather
              from their independent travels into economic capital in the workplace upon their
              return. Drawing on Desforges&#8217;s study, Gill Valentine argues that, through their
              travel, youths &#8220;participate in a process of othering and constructing
              &#64257;rst world representations of the third world, while simultaneously earning
              themselves a privileged position in the West&#8221; (<xref id="IDda8381a0-87df-4fc0-b318-8550460f9a1c" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID97eeb30a-dbb3-4161-a113-93d6ad803040">Valentine 2003, 45</xref>). As student
              Kressi argues, the exchange of the experiences of various places, cultural practices,
              and values within the school community provides students with a variety of &#8220;new
              things&#8221; and/or &#8220;other perspectives&#8221;&#8212;what Binder calls
              &#8220;globality&#8221;&#8212;as cultural capital. This &#8220;globality,&#8221;
              however, does not describe the degree of integration and entanglement of global
              experiences&#8212;the processes of transculturation&#8212;but views them as
              experiences gathered for future benefit. Likewise, the experiences described by Kressi
              are seen, by many students, as helpful for gaining a privileged position in the
              future. As sixteen-year-old Lara phrased it:</p>
            <p>Lara&#8217;s quote shows that growing up abroad and receiving an international
              education is linked to the idea of &#8220;globality&#8221; as cultural capital. Her
              way of imagining a future CV proves this particularly well. Nevertheless, the
              age-specific context has to be kept in mind, where parents play a major role in
              planning their children&#8217;s lives and making decisions in their &#8220;best
              interest&#8221; (see, for instance, the discussions about the move to Shanghai
              described in Part II, Chapter <xref id="ID41757f08-2d80-4f43-a178-8b7440e3a837" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7e90c19c-6be1-487c-b97e-ab4c77119df6">2010, 26</xref>), the
              students and their families use the educational environment and the surrounding
              network to mediate their &#8220;expatriateness.&#8221;1). Some attributions to the
              idea of &#8220;globality&#8221; drawn by Binder&#8217;s study on backpackers, such as
              the alternative experience of everyday life, and a special time for development and
              self-fulfillment are therefore not part of the expatriate youth&#8217;s sense of self.
              Youths consider being abroad a part of everyday life. The conceptualization of
              &#8220;globality&#8221; as the awareness of cultural resources that fit into
              globalized ways of living and subsequently serve as an important identity resource,
              however, is applicable to expatriate youths in Shanghai. It is the school that helps
              to provide, foster, and turn the youths&#8217; global experiences into
              &#8220;globality&#8221; as part of their educational ambitions as well as part of
              establishing their community markers and values. As a result, these international
              schools ultimately foster an international community that can see itself as
              open-minded, diverse, and cosmopolitan without specifically including the local
              neighborhood, Shanghai, or China. These latter places are merely used as stages on
              which one experiences the differences contributing to their &#8220;globality.&#8221;
              While expatriate youths and their families thus create their own communities, which
              often revolve around schools, they practice demarcation towards &#8220;locals&#8221;
              in Shanghai as well as those back &#8220;home&#8221;&#8212;with both groups perceived
              as lacking international experience. Similar to how Brosius, investigating the
              everyday lives of India&#8217;s middle class, conceptualizes cosmopolitanism as
              &#8220;a practice of status-creation&#8221; (</p>
            <p>My three examples show how &#8220;expatriateness&#8221; is performed, maintained, and
              taught among expatriate youths who, under the influence of the international schools,
              and despite differences in their nationality, class, or ethnicity, create a distinct,
              unifying expatriate group consciousness. Looking at the everyday dimensions of
              transnational mobility at an international school, I highlight the significant amounts
              of energy, resources, and organization that go into building and sustaining a
              community with its distinct practices and norms. It becomes apparent that acquiring
              the habitus of an expatriate, to claim belonging to an expatriate community, goes hand
              in hand with processes of demarcation and a certain classism. While the habitus
              includes valuing cosmopolitanism and diversity, demarcation is an essential part in
              claiming these values and turning them into useful capital as &#8220;globality.&#8221;
              As David Ley has argued, &#8220;cosmopolitanism itself is always situated, always
              imbued with partiality and vulnerability&#8221; (<xref id="ID819710c5-4a57-4ee6-9d06-f0f2bb721a9d" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDf278d428-7a8c-41e2-b24c-9a373c99ba8f">Ley 2004, 162</xref>). The performance
              of a collective expatriate identity is thus not only tied to aspiring and learning
              cosmopolitan values, but simultaneously to practices of demarcation towards peers
              perceived as less mobile, globally connected, and educated. For many students, a
              school&#8217;s &#8220;nationality&#8221; does not necessarily correspond to their own,
              such that the school itself is seen as providing an added dimension of
              internationality.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, nationality, in addition to the choice of school, still provides a
              major marker along which various expatriate communities align themselves. It is
              therefore not surprising that access to a German school and the German expatriate
              community proved easier for me than it was to gain similar access to other (school)
              communities. While I have set my focus on the schools&#8217; impact on the process of
              creating collective expatriate identities, it can also be said that sometimes, within
              expatriate communities, in Fechter&#8217;s words, &#8220;national boundaries are still
              anxiously guarded&#8221; (<xref id="IDb9dc7ea9-4b63-4c0b-8d0c-05cc594e4805" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID45d2766b-348c-4645-945d-5b9498aaa4d8">2007b, 110</xref>).
              Despite the efforts made to sustain a sense of community, the student body (as well as
              the staff and parents) at the different international schools is highly diverse and
              internal divides still exist. My discussions with teachers and students from the
              British and American international schools suggest that these internal dividing lines
              might be even stronger at schools with a larger student body and greater ethnic and
              national diversity than the German school I studied. Danau Tanu studied these
              hierarchical divides and the ideal of being &#8220;international&#8221; at an
              international school in Jakarta and succinctly summarizes these dynamics:</p>
            <p>Money and cultural hierarchies influence perceptions and interactions that take place
              on campus. Racial and other identity labels are sometimes used to signify status and
              cultural difference, but their meanings constantly shift and at times bear no
              semblance to actual physical appearance. Various forms of social assets, such as
              language, accents, mannerisms, and money, are used to mark and vie for status. Thus,
              being &#8220;international&#8221; is not a straightforward matter. International
              schools may be a multicultural bubble, but it is a bubble that is not immune to the
              dynamics at work in the world outside the school gates (<xref id="IDbcc44a4f-ff84-4ea0-86ca-d9bfa24e7105" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDd8322f48-1697-4474-8113-e585a223a8e4">2011, 231</xref>).</p>
            <p>As Tanu&#8217;s findings show, the student bodies of international schools are highly
              diverse and crisscrossed by many dividing lines under the guise of a single school
              community or habitus. </p>
            <p>Students&#8217; differing stances on the experiences of international education that
              are presented in the next section allow for a few glimpses into the dividing lines
              underlying school communities. The section captures expatriate youths&#8217;
              reflections on going to an international school by taking up their main narrative of
              privilege and pressure. </p>

              <p>They have like a high standard of learning and if you don't have good grades, you

                teachers get emails, you are like blacklisted. You have to have As or Bs to like do
                stuff at my school. If you have a C, forget about it. Parents are called and stuff.
                It is really a tough type. But, on the other hand, all the teachers are really

          <p>&#8220;Tough type&#8221; but &#8220;really nice,&#8221; as Paul, a student at an
            American Christian school in Shanghai puts it, succinctly summarizes the student
            discourse about these international schools. It is a discourse I encountered in various
            narratives revolving around the privilege&#8212;and pressure&#8212;associated with
            international education. </p>
          <p>Fourteen-year-old Keith from Singapore, for example, praises the positive aspects, the
            privileges of international education.</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s131">
              <speaker>Keith</speaker>
              <p>Well, I think, academic wise, the school is very open, to erm, every student.
                Especially in the international school, because they are dealing with very different
                cultures. So, for one the school is very open. So, it teaches different things at
                different levels, for different students. Like some are better in English, some are
                so-so. They split them into groups, and just, I think it is very helpful and
                effective in teaching them. And they also have lots of extra-curriculum activities.
                Like sports and other forms of activities. And I think that is good, because it
                helps teach and educate in a very different and interesting way.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Keith, attending an international British school in Shanghai, is clearly proud of his
            educational institution and, during the group interview, continuously stresses its
            quality. He describes his school as &#8220;open&#8221; and attending to the various
            needs of a diverse student body. Many students described their educational experience in
            similar ways. German student Peter, reflecting on his education, feels that the
            privileged environment renders schooling easier.</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s132">
              <speaker>Peter</speaker>
              <p>For me, school is easier here. Or rather, you simply study much better here and
                that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s easier. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s all much more efficient
                here.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Peter bases his argument for school being &#8220;easier&#8221; on the privileged
            circumstances under which lessons take place. During the lessons I attended, I also
            observed small class sizes, new equipment, and teachers who address students (and their
            problems) individually, thus supporting those who have difficulties, rather than simply
            giving them a bad grade. Based on this learning environment, Peter consequently argues
            that many of his fellow students would not be able to succeed in the same way at other
            schools that would require much more assertiveness. While some students thus experience
            private schooling as a mark of privilege&#8212;a privilege that echoes the theme of
            comfort and luxury presented in my first example, &#8220;Everyday
            Comfort&#8221;&#8212;others feel this privilege is tied to pressure. Mia, for instance,
            who indirectly compares her school in Shanghai to elite schools in Germany and thus
            stresses her privileged form of education, also relates her school environment to a
            communal pressure to perform well.</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s133">
              <speaker> Mia</speaker>
              <p>And [school] is somehow taken much more seriously here than in Germany. I believe
                here they all want an average of 1.3 or 1.4 [straight-As in the German grading
                system] and, in Germany, they often don&#8217;t care. Elite schools also exist in
                Germany, but in general, if you just ask around, for instance when friends move and
                then talk about their school, then you always think to yourself: &#8220;What? They
                are happy about a 4 [equivalent to a D or a pass]?!&#8221;</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>The pressure to perform well can certainly be found among students elsewhere. Many
            expatriate youths, however, depict this pressure as particularly crucial to their school
            experience in Shanghai. Norwegian student Britta, from a British school, and Charlie,
            from the German school and a member of &#8220;the girls,&#8221; explain:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s134">
              <speaker>Britta</speaker>
              <p>And also in IB [International Baccalaureate], I pretty much have to do like
                homework at least two hours every day. So, I don't really have that much, like, time
                after school. Just have to eat, and then do my homework. And then I have to go to
                bed as soon as possible after my homework. I get so tired. That is also something I
                don't like here. </p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s135">
              <speaker>Charlie</speaker>
              <p>I somehow feel the pressure at the German school in Shanghai is also much higher.
                Actually, I can&#8217;t really say. [&#8230;] But I find the pressure very strong
                here.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>When talking to me, the students (and those at the German school, in particular) often
            drew comparisons to schooling elsewhere, stressing the comparatively high expectations
            of their schools in Shanghai, as Paul&#8217;s, Mia&#8217;s, Britta&#8217;s, and
            Charlie&#8217;s remarks demonstrate. </p>
          <p>To delineate the various factors leading to such pressure (or at least the perception
            of it) I want to discuss Charlie&#8217;s perspective on schooling and pressure in detail
            and use her voice as one case-in-point. Charlie was sixteen when I first met her. Her
            parents were born in China and met in Germany during their studies at university.
            Charlie grew up in Germany and her parents took on German nationality. In the beginning
            of her high school years, her family decided to move to Shanghai. </p>
          <p>One day, when I interview Charlie out in the schoolyard during her free period, she
            abruptly changes the topic (we are discussing the rising taxi fares in China) and
            announces:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s136">
              <speaker>Charlie</speaker>
              <p>I am scared of the Abitur [A-Levels or final exams for the diploma].</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s137">
              <speaker>Interviewer</speaker>
              <p>What is it that scares you most about it?</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s138">
              <speaker>Charlie</speaker>
              <p>That in the end&#8230; Well, in the end I would really like to study medicine. And
                I am afraid that I won&#8217;t succeed. Directly. I don&#8217;t want to wait for six
                semesters or so to get in. Then I would rather study something else. Because
                medicine already takes so long, then I would already be, no idea, twenty. And when
                I&#8217;m forty I would still be studying or something. Yes. That&#8217;s why I
                sometimes put myself a little bit under pressure. And Antonia always puts herself
                under a lot of pressure, too, because she, too, wants to study medicine. But her
                grades are really good. She doesn&#8217;t even need to put herself under pressure.
                And then, when I&#8217;m standing next to her and she starts to put herself under
                pressure&#8212;&#8220;I won&#8217;t make it! I won&#8217;t make
                it!&#8221;&#8212;then I think, &#8220;Okay, I can just forget about it.&#8221; </p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Due to her wish to go to medical school in Germany, Charlie demands perfect scores and
            grades from herself. While she already has doubts about her success, the fact that
            others at her school also fear failing entrance into med school makes her feel even more
            pressured. </p>
          <p>When I discussed the high pressure to perform with teachers at the international
            schools, many pointed at the high involvement of parents in their children&#8217;s
            education. During my fieldwork, I also came across the idea of
            &#8220;tiger-mothers&#8221; (<xref id="ID4da71431-7d43-4c70-ad93-d46fe504346b" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID1aec28ce-d25c-4c03-a58b-d4c586ceb038">Chua 2011</xref>), those
            who constantly challenge their children by enrolling them in further educational
            activities from piano lessons to Chinese tutoring. There is indeed a hyper activity in
            many students&#8217; lives that seems to go hand-in-hand with expatriate
            (hyper)mobility; both are seen as beneficial for the development of the child. When I
            ask Charlie about her parents&#8217; views about her med school plans, she explains:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s139">

              <p>Yes. I would really like to do it, but I also don&#8217;t want them to... No idea.
                I think it&#8217;s maybe not that important to my parents. But, I don&#8217;t know.
                It&#8217;s somehow important to me that I don&#8217;t disappoint my parents. No
                idea. It sounds really stupid.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>The pressure of parental expectations, as Charlie voices them, is something many
            students share regardless of where they are. I feel, however, that in the case of the
            expatriate teenagers in Shanghai, their parents, as successful transnational
            professionals, set the bar particularly high. Still, Charlie, a straight-A student,
            thinks her parents are not necessarily demanding too much. She explains to me that her
            parents were rather conservative and her father had voiced his thoughts that, if Charlie
            were a boy, he would be much stricter and his expectations for her grades would be much
            higher. &#8220;I think he already gave up on it a little bit,&#8221;Charlie contemplates
            during our conversation in the schoolyard. When I voice my surprise about her
            father&#8217;s position, she elaborates:</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s142">
              <speaker>Charlie</speaker>
              <p>Yes, they just meant, probably, that boys have to work and so on and earn big
                money. And my parents just think that, if I study medicine, I should open a
                practice. Have a child. Just laid-back. [&#8230;]</p>

              <speaker>Charlie</speaker>
              <p>No. But my parents think, well, university is really laid-back and so on. But I
                think that&#8217;s also because they were in China before that. And studying in
                Germany is likely to be more relaxed than school in China. [&#8230;] But my parents
                are actually pretty lenient. Well, for being Chinese parents. &lt;L&gt; Because they
                also let me go party in the evenings. Well, they don&#8217;t like it if I go out too
                often. But once in a while is okay. And they support it when I do something with
                friends and so on. Just now they think studying for the Abitur is the most important
                issue. But there are also parents who don&#8217;t allow that at all.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Like Charlie, expat youths generally consider Chinese schooling to be hard and academic
            success more important for Chinese parents. Consequently, at the schools, I regularly
            came across the prevailing conception among expat teenagers that those who have Chinese
            parents were automatically under more pressure than their peers from other backgrounds.
            Although friendships between students with Asian or non-Asian backgrounds were normal, I
            felt that having a Chinese parent was sometimes a dividing line that subtly underlay the
            shared experience of school. Through the eyes of the teenagers at the German school, for
            instance, high expectations from parents with Chinese roots are normal and also thought
            to indirectly influence the overall pressure to perform for all students in class. In
            school, a student&#8217;s &#8220;Chineseness&#8221; is thus often equated with diligent
            studying, learning to play an instrument, and abstinence from nightlife activities, due
            to the parents&#8217; assumed objections. Students often play with these stereotypes and
            use them as a basis for jokes. They see their own international education as influenced
            by &#8220;Chinese&#8221; pressure and high expectations. Some students, mostly those who
            are relatively new to the expatriate community in Shanghai, voice their
            annoyance&#8212;sometimes by again &#8220;othering&#8221; students with Chinese
            backgrounds&#8212;about the pressure to perform.</p>
          <p>
            <speech id="s145">
              <speaker>Lara</speaker>
              <p>And we don&#8217;t have to say that it&#8217;s bad to be good at school, or to
                think about the future. We do that, too. But we don&#8217;t say it. The strong
                interest [in school] here [leads to] other things being pushed to the back that are
                actually pretty important for enjoying life. I mean, I don&#8217;t live only to have
                achieved something in sixty years. No friends, no contacts and then I die.
                That&#8217;s not the meaning of life; I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
            </speech>
          </p>
          <p>Lara criticizes the importance her classmates place on having good grades. This
            emphasis is likely connected to the pressure to work hard for future success. This focus
            on the future is discussed in more detail in Part IV, Chapter 1. </p>
          <p>Privilege and pressure thus seem to have a dialectic relationship in the
            students&#8217; narratives and lives. The awareness of enjoying a privileged education
            and lifestyle, for some students, also carries with it the pressure to perform well. In
            all expatriate families, careers&#8212;and the education perceived as necessary to excel
            at them&#8212;are almost always viewed as highly important; they are considered worth
            the move to Shanghai to begin with. Unemployed parents are altogether unknown in the
            expatriate community. While the community is heterogeneous and class divides within
            Shanghai&#8217;s expatria of course exist, the international students also have no
            classmates whose parents have a working-class background. However, as I observed during
            my fieldwork at the German school, students are quite aware of the differences in degree
            of pressure exerted on students with Chinese versus Western backgrounds. </p>

          <title>3.5. Concluding thoughts on &#8220;expatriateness&#8221; and the role of
            schools</title>
          <p>This chapter examined expatriate youths&#8217; shared experiences of belonging to an
            international school community&#8212;an experience that the student Allen, in the
            beginning of this chapter, described as everyone being in &#8220;the same space.&#8221;
            I described how this space is shaped by Shanghai&#8217;s specific international school
            landscape, which does not allow Chinese passport holders to enroll at any of these
            schools unless special circumstances exist. These schools are therefore almost
            hermetically sealed spaces. At the same time, as the second subsection illustrated, the
            schools put much effort into creating a shared experience for students. This building of
            a school community is based on establishing certain &#8220;social aesthetics&#8221;
              (<xref id="ID7ce48bea-ef44-44fe-826b-2f3e8203d370" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDc5e6be1c-eb9b-4f60-b29f-0f410fe3c5ba">MacDougall 2006</xref>) that involve a
            specific material culture and concrete everyday routines for students. The resulting
            school communities are all unified in the collective experience of belonging to an
            expatriate network in Shanghai. The schools here play a vital role in mediating what it
            means to be or act like an expatriate. In this way, the schools not only affect
            students&#8217; lives, but also those of their families. They are community hubs for
            Shanghai&#8217;s expatria and offer parents an entrance to an expatriate community. I
            therefore argue that it is precisely in the spaces of the international schools that
            collective expatriate identities are negotiated and mediated on an everyday
            basis&#8212;through community events, communal valuing of the school as a site for the
            youths&#8217; (cosmopolitan) formation, and through the admission process that requires
            the &#8220;right&#8221; financial means or jobs, the &#8220;right&#8221; passports, and
            the &#8220;right&#8221; grades. The schools are seen as bringing together students from
            various international backgrounds, but&#8212;as with the gated communities&#8212;the
            diversity there is controlled. However, while the negotiations of collective expatriate
            identities forge a common consensus on what it means to be an expatriate in Shanghai,
            they do not always bridge internal divides, particularly along the lines of nationality
            or ethnicity, as the student discourse on the privilege and pressure of international
            education and the role of Chinese parents reveals. </p>
          <p>The controlled spaces of the schools are largely shaped by their institutional
            frameworks, but there are also places that teenagers seek out and shape on their own.
            These places are crucial for enabling teenagers to gain meaning and agency in their
            migration experience. As Massey (<xref id="ID15ca6a55-8aa9-473e-9002-a3e459626211" ref-type="bibr" rid="IDfd81278b-25be-488b-bb36-c64aa4cf348d">1995, 207</xref>)
            succinctly notes, &#8220;making of place is part of constructing the identity and
            coherence of the social group itself.&#8221; It is these reciprocal processes of space
            and age/group identity performances that the next part, &#8220;Arriving,&#8221;
            foregrounds, with the aim of further understanding how expatriate youth culture is
            caught in the dynamics of &#8220;uprootings and regroundings&#8221; (<xref id="IDd90ccb22-5376-48ab-9a27-c0dc71ec0b30" ref-type="bibr" rid="ID7201ea40-7aeb-4a06-a437-33fe2ab1bd45">Ahmed et al. 2003</xref>),

        <p> In a commentary on spatial metaphors and speaking positions, Geraldine Pratt warns
          against the &#8220;rhetoric of mobility and detachment from place&#8220; (1992, 241) that
          increasingly informs the metaphors used in contemporary cultural studies literature. This
          rhetoric praises mobility and privileges movement in the production of knowledge. Pratt
          argues that these metaphors run the risk of promoting an understanding of dwelling that
          focuses solely on reactionary ideas or problems, as in some forms of nationalism, for
          example, and calls for understanding dwelling also as &#8220;the legitimacy and value of
          peoples&#8217; struggles to create their own places and memories&#8221; (Pratt 1992, 243).
          Pratt emphasizes that this focus needs to accompany &#8220;the rhetoric of movement that
          privileges detachment from place&#8221; in order to &#8220;break down a new hierarchy of
          difference created through the seemingly fashionable mobility&#8212;dwelling
          duality&#8221; (ibid.).</p>

        <p>Habitus, as described by Bourdieu in &#8220;The Forms of Capital,&#8221; can be
          understood as a person&#8217;s unconscious embodiment of cultural capital over time (1986,
          244&#8211;245). However, the term simultaneously characterizes the formative relations
          between individuals and their socio-cultural surroundings, as Bourdieu argues in his work
          Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste (1984, 170): &#8220;The habitus is
          not only a structuring structure, which organizes practices and the perception of
          practices, but also a structured structure: the principle of division into logical classes
          which organizes the perception of the social world [that] is itself the product of
          internalization of the division into social classes.&#8221;</p>

        <p> In the 1980s, George Marcus summarized the research on the elite, whether taking a
          &#8220;pluralist view&#8221; or the &#8220;&#8216;power elite&#8217; view&#8221; (1983a,
          13), as having &#8220;failed to pay systematic attention to the cultures and forms of life
          of those identified as elites&#8221; (ibid., 25). While, on the one hand, Marcus
          considered the anthropology of elites suitable to fill this lacuna in research, he, on the
          other hand, regarded the earlier research frameworks of contrasting elites to the masses
          as &#8220;the least adequate for empirical investigation&#8221; (ibid., 13):</p>
        <p>For the ethnographer, relating elites to corporate systems, rather than to specific
          people, requires the ability to define closely observed subjects as elites, not in
          relativistic terms which would be appropriate for small-scale societies, but in reference
          to the total larger system in which they are elites. Thus, selection of elites as
          ethnographic subjects presupposes considerable prior knowledge or guesswork about the
          nature of the larger system in which it is meaningful to label them as elites (Marcus
          1983a, 13).</p>
        <p>Marcus also saw the term &#8220;in its manifestation as an Anglo-Amercian research
          tradition&#8221; (1983a, 25) as an &#8220;uncertain guide&#8221; regarding how it could be
          appropriately applied to research on elites in a range of different societies. Almost two
          decades later, Shore and Nugent (2002) edited another volume on the study of the elite in
          anthropology, which connects similar issues and questions, as in the anthology edited by
          Marcus (1983b). Shore and Nugent&#8217;s volume further stresses the anthropology of the
          elite as &#8220;an exercise in political reflexivity&#8221; since it obliges
          anthropologists to position themselves &#8220;more self-consciously in relation to the
          wider system of power and hierarchy within which anthropological knowledge is
          constructed&#8221; (Shore 2002, 2). </p>
