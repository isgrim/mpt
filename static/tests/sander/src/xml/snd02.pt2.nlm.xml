            <title>Part II: Leaving</title>
            <p>Expatriate children often have biographies that involve several moves over the course
                of their young lives. Part II, &#8220;Leaving,&#8221; addresses retrospective
                accounts given by students on the circumstances of moving to Shanghai. It inquires
                into how expatriate youths perceive multiple relocations in general and considers
                what kind of challenges they face. Chapter 1 explores the youths&#8217; narratives
                of leaving and their recollections of the processes that led to the decision to move
                to Shanghai. In this chapter, I argue that expatriate children have only limited
                agency in the familial decision-making as it concerns the move. Next, I investigate
                the idea of &#8220;best interest&#8221; that underlies many of the arguments for the
                move. While the parents&#8217; feel they are making a decision which is in the
                &#8220;best interest&#8221; of the child and is mostly linked to future benefits,
                the children, in the here-and-now, constantly feel like they are living in a liminal
                space, where the last move has only just&#8212;or not even yet&#8212;been fully
                coped with, despite the next move already lying in wait. Chapter 2 is also connected
                to discussions about leaving and delineates the emotional challenges associated with
                moving to Shanghai. Based on the students&#8217; commentaries, this chapter
                identifies their &#8220;culture shock,&#8221; reactions to an unfamiliar urban
                environment, new sensory impressions, and the lack of friends and extended family,
                as well as problems within the family, that are also related to the move. The
                different experiences of youths all make clear that the time of leaving and
                arriving&#8212;or what Ahmed, Casta&#241;eda, Fortier, and Sheller (<xref rid="ID9f40d963-1d5b-4518-8e5d-45d38b299316" ref-type="bibr" id="ID62e89bf2-edea-4b1f-849a-04422867ec64">2003</xref>) call
                &#8220;uprootings&#8221;&#8212;are highly emotional. Part II, which is based on the
                youths&#8217; retrospective narratives, provides a brief but essential background to
                the inquiries into the expatriate students&#8217; daily practices in Shanghai that
                the following parts of this book, on arriving and living, explore in more depth.</p>

            <sec>
                <title>Chapter 1: Retrospectives on the Decision to Move</title>
                <disp-quote>
                    <p>I suggest that more could be done in migration studies to understand
                        &#8220;the best interests of the child&#8221; by taking account of his or
                        her own perspective (<xref rid="ID2509aafb-e92e-4dd8-a5a0-b908285ba792" ref-type="bibr" id="ID40edede6-80de-4ba3-9888-be4fc9a9f605">Dobson 2009,
                            355</xref>).</p>
                </disp-quote>
                <p>When talking about the move to Shanghai with students in group discussions or
                    individual interviews, the expatriate youths described their experiences of the
                    decision-making process that led to the move to Shanghai. When contemplating
                    these retrospectives of the move, it becomes obvious that the moments of
                    decision-making are remembered vividly. </p>

                <sec>
                    <title>1.1 To move or not to move: the decision-making process</title>
                    <p>By examining the children&#8217;s reflections upon the decision that was made
                        months, or even years, prior to the interviews, it becomes clear that my
                        interview partners reflected deeply upon their role in the process.
                        Throughout our conversations, three narratives of the children&#8217;s
                        involvement in the decision-making process became apparent: exclusion,
                        inclusion through a set of choices, and negotiation. As I only conducted my
                        research in Shanghai, of course only those voices of children whose families
                        actually decided to move are included. Rejections of the opportunity to move
                        to Shanghai, therefore, cannot be discussed.</p>
                    <p>Most of my young interview partners felt excluded from the decision-making
                        process and describe the move to Shanghai as a non-negotiable announcement
                        their parents made. Usually, the children did not want to move, but often
                        felt they had no choice, as Emily&#8217;s story illustrates. Emily, age
                        twelve, was born in her &#8220;home&#8221; country Malaysia, but left when
                        she was still too young to retain any memories of growing up there. She
                        arrived in Shanghai one and a half years prior to the interview and attends
                        a British English-medium middle school. When I interview her with fellow
                        students in a group discussion, she introduces herself by talking quickly
                        and animatedly:</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s1">
                            <speaker>Emily</speaker>
                            <p>I am Emily. I am from Malaysia. I am, I have never really lived or
                                had any childhood in Malaysia. I moved when I was three and my
                                brother was only six months old. I moved to Beijing, China, and I
                                lived there for six years, six and a half years, close to seven. And
                                then I moved to Thailand for eighteen months, which felt like a
                                really long time.</p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>She recalls her moving experiences as a set of events that would simply
                        happen to her, leading up to a feeling of unfair exclusion when the recent
                        move to Shanghai was announced.</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s2">
                            <speaker>Emily</speaker>
                            <p>So I kinda started to realize, that is not fair, mom; that is not
                                fair that we have to move. And then, but then I had no choice. I had
                                to follow my parents. So, I moved to Shanghai, and after Christmas
                                would be my second year here. Erm, it&#8217;s nice here, I will be
                                disappointed if I do leave next year, but yeah.</p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>Karina, seventeen years old and attending &#8220;my&#8221; 11th grade class
                        at the German school, shares a similar story. She is half-Czech,
                        half-German, and came to Shanghai six months before the first interview.
                        When we sit in the schoolyard, the voice recorder between us, Karina
                        introduces herself by narrating her migration story as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s3">
                            <speaker>Karina</speaker>
                            <p><italic>I am seventeen years old. I come from Prague. I was also born there
                                and lived there for five years, I believe. After that, I moved to
                                Germany and lived there for three years. Then I moved to [a city in
                                Northern China], lived there for another three years. [&#8230;] Then I
                            moved back to Prague, and now I am back in China.</italic>

                    </p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>Karina recapitulates her immediate strong reaction to the announcement of the
                        move to Shanghai: &#8220;I just screamed at my father.&#8221; I came across
                        many such narratives of anger, yelling at, or not speaking to the parents
                        for a couple of days in reaction to the sudden announcement of the move. </p>
                    <p>A few interviewees, however, such as Britta, a student from Norway, felt they
                        had a say in the decision by discussing at least certain options about their
                        participation in the move. When describing her first reactions to her
                        father&#8217;s announcement, Britta, a seventeen-year-old girl who had just
                        arrived in Shanghai a few months before the interview and attends an
                        international British school, recalls how she could not believe it or take
                        the idea of moving to China seriously at first. </p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s4">
                            <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                            <p>I wasn&#8217;t that mad; I was more like I didn&#8217;t think about
                                it. I just said sure, we move to China. Not.</p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>However, when she started to realize that her parents were seriously
                        considering the move, she found herself and her family on a short trip to
                        China to explore the idea further. Such &#8220;look-and-see trips,&#8221;
                        which are paid for by the employer, are common. Yet, taking the children
                        along for these trips is less common. Consequently, Britta considered
                        herself lucky to have been able to get to know Shanghai before the final
                        decision to relocate was made. Furthermore, she explains how her family
                        explored alternative options:</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s5">
                            <speaker>Britta</speaker>
                            <p>I could have stayed at my friend&#8217;s house, lived with my best
                                friend&#8217;s family. But I chose to go anyway. So. Would be weird
                                to just move in with her family when my family is just experiencing
                                new stuff, and I am just like stuck in Norway. </p>
                        </speech>
                    </p>
                    <p>The opportunity to see what her life might look like in Shanghai and the
                        option of staying in Europe with a friend made her feel included in the
                        decision-making process and led to a positive curiosity and willingness to
                        explore new things with her family: &#8220;They didn&#8217;t just decide,
                        they let us choose.&#8221; Britta&#8217;s case can be seen as what Ackers
                        and Stalford (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID1e71ec37-4d8f-4952-961c-d1bd2bf8f7e1">2004,

                        &#8220;children&#8217;s menu approach.&#8221; The children are presented
                        with a &#8220;limited range of options&#8221; (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="IDeb08c8e6-32ae-47a7-8171-da5fda69327a">ibid., 113</xref>), with
                        these options typically falling &#8220;within parameters tightly defined by
                        parents&#8221; (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3735b23b-a6f8-47f8-914f-10aec6c512d6">ibid.</xref>). Britta, for instance, was allowed to opt out of the move to
                        Shanghai, but not allowed to influence her parents&#8217; decision.</p>
                    <p>Only seventeen-year-old Paul, whose story I discussed in the introduction,
                        described how he successfully managed to negotiate the decision about a
                        move, though in his case, it was the move away from and not to Shanghai.
                        Paul grew up in Brazil and the United States and moved to Shanghai six years
                        prior to the interview. At the time of the interview, he had just refused to
                        move again, this time to Thailand. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t gonna move,&#8221;
                        he said. His father, nevertheless, went to Bangkok, while Paul and his
                        mother stayed in Shanghai. Paul&#8217;s initial reluctance to move to China,
                        which, to reiterate his phrase, he had not &#8220;even googled
                        before,&#8221; played no role in his parents&#8217; decision. </p>
                    <p>In contrast to his lack of say in the matter and the fait accompli his father
                        delivered (&#8220;&#8216;Paul, we are moving to China.&#8217; Oh.&#8221;)
                        six years earlier, this time Paul managed to state his own opinion about the
                        move to Thailand and make his point. When I ask him about the difference in

                            <p>I am older now. Before I didn't really have a choice. And, erm, my
                                parents also thought it was a good idea to stay here. Cause of my
                                last year of school. You don't wanna move right before you are
                                applying for colleges and stuff. And your grades are really shit.
                                It's not so good. </p>

                    <p>This time he influenced the decision-making process and the family found
                        common ground when reasoning why staying in Shanghai was beneficial for his
                        future. Interestingly, Paul had learned to employ a future-benefit and
                        best-interest narrative to argue for his desire to stay, and his parents
                        accepted it. The next section further examines the common idea of
                        best-interest that often underlies the parents&#8217; decision-making and
                        family relationships.</p>

                    <p>As my interview-partners&#8217; narratives of the moving process show,
                        individual family members have different attitudes and interests regarding
                        the move to Shanghai. While some children rebel against the decision, others
                        trust their parents to know what is &#8220;best&#8221; for them. According
                        to my young interview-partners&#8217; accounts of the decision to move, the
                        idea of their parents acting in their &#8220;best interest&#8221; is also
                        common. Teresa Hutchins&#8217;s (<xref rid="ID52a1d379-f210-42a7-88f9-a98d0a284520" ref-type="bibr" id="IDdcf93edc-90d5-4170-a62a-4ca8e92d5ad8">2011</xref>) recent analysis
                        of UK families&#8217; experiences with moving to Australia, showed that </p>
                    <p>family migration decision-making is based upon a process of negotiating
                        individual influence and power within the family, often at different stages
                        in the process. In the majority of families, children were active in their
                        attempts to influence adults, just as adults attempted to influence
                        children. In some cases the adults overrode the opinions of their children
                        and in others the children were successful in having their voices heard and
                        acted upon. In the majority of instances, parents justified their actions as
                        being in the best interests of their children (<xref rid="ID52a1d379-f210-42a7-88f9-a98d0a284520" ref-type="bibr" id="ID267cf99b-d03f-41f5-9847-d52b50a783f6">Hutchins 2011,

                    <p>The main difference between the experiences of Hutchins&#8217;s informants
                        moving to Australia, and the narratives explored in this ethnography,
                        however, lies in the experience of Australia as a place of arrival and
                        Shanghai as a place of transition. Parents&#8217; decisions to move are not
                        only past events, but likely to be announced in the future, as well. When
                        talking about moving again in the near future and the emotions this prospect
                        causes, Allen, an eleven-year old American who had just arrived in Shanghai
                        after his father had been transferred to China three months earlier,

                        has pointed out correctly that this idea of children&#8217;s best interests
                        is problematic and that &#8220;little is known about how &#8216;best
                        interests&#8217; are conceptualised, let alone operationalised, within
                        families.&#8221; Hutchins further argues that these varying
                        conceptualizations of best interest are based on the &#8220;particular
                        conception of childhood held by [...] parents&#8221; (<xref rid="ID52a1d379-f210-42a7-88f9-a98d0a284520" ref-type="bibr" id="ID739d0586-7d59-47fc-850b-168f96b75c7f">2011, 1233</xref>). In the
                        expatriate community in Shanghai, the underlying conceptions of childhood
                        and adolescence often seem to be linked to the idea of children as
                        &#8220;adults in the making,&#8221; a viewpoint that is also influential in
                        academic concepts, as already critiqued in the Introduction. My discussions
                        with children, as well as interviews I conducted with adult expatriates in
                            2007,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e161">2</xref> show that expatriate
                        parents in Shanghai justify the difficulties they impose on their children
                        by stressing the&#8212;mainly future&#8212;benefits of transnational
                        mobility. Parents are concerned with their children&#8217;s adult lives,
                        sometimes even more than with their children&#8217;s current situation, as
                        the family&#8217;s move to China suggests. These supposed benefits and the
                        teenage students&#8217; experiences with this future-oriented aspect of
                        their lives are discussed in detail in Part IV, Chapter 1 and in Part III,
                        Chapter 3 of this ethnography. Ackers and Stalford (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID8005ecae-c010-419c-b8fb-3806b80ac71c">2004, 111</xref>),
                        researchers of European children&#8217;s rights, came across a similar
                        narrative of the decision-making process in their studies of EU-internal
                        migration&#8212;that of &#8220;future oriented consent,&#8221; where
                        &#8220;parents expressed the view that, even though it was inappropriate to
                        attempt to involve the child in the family decision at the point of
                        migration, the child would, in the longer term, see the value of the move
                        and reflect upon it positively&#8220; (<xref rid="ID8fc88b2e-9680-4570-9131-f91d6fa2c941" ref-type="bibr" id="ID19c6e414-0006-4dfa-b45c-40d9114292109">Ackers and Stalford 2004,

                    <p>Hoping for this future consent of their children, expatriate parents often
                        disregard their potential to play an active part in the decision to move.
                        Hutchins (<xref rid="ID52a1d379-f210-42a7-88f9-a98d0a284520" ref-type="bibr" id="ID231ed363-32a3-4ed3-8db6-1f878e9c9080">2011, 1233</xref>) assumes
                        that &#8220;it is also possible that the different conceptions of childhood
                        operate in parallel and that particular conceptions may be invoked at
                        different times in order to support the interests of adults.&#8221; The
                        powerful discourse of &#8220;best interest&#8221; is linked to ideas of
                        preparing the developing child for the future and is often used to exclude
                        children from the decision-making process. The concept of &#8220;best
                        interest&#8221; therefore strongly influences expatriate families&#8217;
                        decisions to move abroad.</p>
                    <p>Excluded from the decision to relocate, the students I talked to remember
                        being caught between the desire to stay with their friends in their familiar
                        environment and the wish to be with their parents. In the midst of these
                        contradictory feelings, children also have their own &#8220;best
                        interest&#8221; considerations for their parents. Seventeen-year-old German
                        student Lara explains: </p>

                                think. I mean, you can at least have a look at it. But, then there
                                is not really a coming back option. But also, that a father wants

                    <p>Lara&#8217;s narrative illustrates how the decision to move feels, for many
                        of the youths, like being caught between their parents&#8217; will and their
                        own. For intergenerational relations, this means that worries about the
                        other exist on both sides. Often, guilt may also play a role and complicate
                        family relationships. Karina, for instance, explained that her mother often
                        felt guilty about taking her away from her friends. Twelve-year-old Emily
                        from Malaysia describes how family relationships can become strained by the
                        emotional turmoil that a decision to move causes:</p>
                    <p>
                        <speech id="s11">

                            <p>I think that one of the worst things to do is to actually panic,
                                because eventually you realize you have to move. You can&#8217;t
                                just stay there. Because, you know. Then, when I realized, you know,
                                when my dad said we are moving, I said &#8220;Okay, if we are
                                moving, will there be a chance that we ever move back here?&#8221;
                                He said &#8220;Erm, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; When you hear that
                                &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or that tone where you just have no
                                clue, you just know that you have to move. You can&#8217;t say
                                anything, because your parents would get, like, not upset, but kinda
                                feeling, having second thoughts now. I don&#8217;t want my parents
                                not to move just because of me. But it&#8217;s for my dad&#8217;s
                                job, so like, we just all have to move. As a family. We can&#8217;t
                                like stay here and my dad working there, and then coming back for
                                Christmas, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense. So we just have to
                                move.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Emily&#8217;s narrative demonstrates well how children try to actively negotiate the
                relations within the family, reflect their own position, and consider their
                parents&#8217; needs. Her thoughts on moving go beyond her own wish to stay and
                explore moving&#8217;s effects on family relationships and her parents&#8217;
                emotional well-being. She does not want her parents to worry about her or have
                &#8220;second thoughts&#8221; and comes to the conclusion that opposing the move is
                not an option. Emily&#8217;s inquiries about the option to move back also show how
                children wish to have insights into their parents&#8217; plans and transparency
                about future moves. This might also be necessary for children to (re-)gain trust in
                their parents&#8217; decisions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bibd2e260">4</xref>

                    <p>Uncertainties of what to expect are obviously inherent to a migration
                        experience. The fear of suddenly moving elsewhere (and failing to
                        &#8220;make it&#8221; there), however, seems particularly common within
                        highly mobile families. Emily&#8217;s description of her thoughts and past
                        feelings surrounding the move to Shanghai show that moving can be
                        overwhelming. She even speaks of panic over her inabiliaty to control the
                        decision to move and her emotions. Likewise, all the narratives of the
                        decision-making process show that the teenagers and children often
                        confronted their parents with anger when the move to China was announced.
                        From Emily&#8217;s point of view, however, to panic is &#8220;one of the
                        worst things to do.&#8221; Her narrative shows that children have to cope
                        with fears and that moving requires them to learn to manage their emotions.
                        The fear of having to move again, against one&#8217;s own will, however,
                        remains present, even when the students turn the limbo-like state of moving,
                        the experience of living in a liminal space, into something positive, as was
                        the case for seventeen-year-old Giovanni, a German school student and part
                        of &#8220;the boys,&#8221; who noted: &#8220;You are only here for a

                    <p>The honest inclusion of children in the decision-making and moving process
                        might help to reduce some of their fears and feelings of powerlessness.
                        Britta from Norway, for example, was extremely happy to have been able to
                        explore Shanghai before the move, which made it easier for her to cope with
                        the fear of being unhappy in Shanghai. But it is not only uncertainty, but
                        also unfamiliarity or even sensing their parents&#8217; stress that makes
                        the experience frightening at first. The next chapter, consequently, takes a
                        closer look at the emotional challenges that leaving entails from the
                        perspective of expatriate students, while also drawing upon concepts which
                        explore the anthropology of emotions.</p>

                <p>The tyranny of distance and the particularities of place continue to unsettle
                    agents with a putatively global reach. (<xref rid="IDee03d702-f218-4e08-add0-da0c9c436c1e" ref-type="bibr" id="IDea022ada-37ab-48b4-9355-91d39b7aef97">Ley 2004, 157</xref>)</p>
                <p>Cultural geographer David Ley describes how moving abroad can be unsettling, even
                    for agents like the expatriate youths in this study who, in many cases, have
                    moved several times across the globe. In Shanghai, the teenagers and I discussed
                    their initial reactions to the decision to move, as well as the feelings that
                    leaving, arriving, and adjusting caused. Examining their reactions to their
                    parents&#8217; announcement of the move to Shanghai and the students&#8217;
                    experiences of relocating, it becomes clear that their reflections during the
                    interviews revolve around their emotions. This finding is in agreement with
                    sociologist Christine Mattley&#8217;s (<xref rid="IDdc69ee77-cc70-40c8-a86b-a118dfde6aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID75bf6d84-ac4d-4d3b-90ff-a464ec2082ee">2002, 365</xref>) argument that
                    feeling and reflecting are not opposed to each other, but that emotions provoke
                    and are also caused by reflection. Combining interactionist theories on emotion
                    and temporality, Mattley points out four dimensions we should consider when
                    thinking about the meaning of past emotions:</p>
                <p>We often endeavor to understand present emotions, through referencing our past
                    emotions and the usual assumption is that past emotions are given&#8212;that
                    they are real. However, that is not necessarily the case. Again, drawing on
                    Maines, Sugrue, and Katovich (<xref rid="IDdc69ee77-cc70-40c8-a86b-a118dfde6aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID87d9739d-b41e-4620-bb44-c9df41c8ae8d">1983</xref>), it
                    is reasonable to suggest that moving backward, individuals may (1) symbolically
                    reconstruct past emotion such that they have meaning for the present emotion,
                    (2) note how past emotion structures and conditions emotions found in the
                    present, (3) recognize the implied objective emotional past, and (4) create a
                    mythical past emotion to explain the present one (<xref rid="IDdc69ee77-cc70-40c8-a86b-a118dfde6aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID9dc6fb5b-1f51-4a14-9834-776ba2ec4c51">Mattley 2002, 370</xref>).</p>
                <p>When discussing past emotions with the teenagers, keeping Mattley&#8217;s link
                    between emotions and temporality in mind helps me recognize not only the
                    students&#8217; past emotional difficulties but also their present and ongoing
                    efforts to come to terms with their moving experiences. Interactionist theories
                    prove to be well-suited for explaining these feelings and the youths&#8217; ways
                    of dealing with them because they have conceptualized emotions as emerging from
                    social acts within groups. In our case, this emergence takes place not only
                    within the family and among new friends in Shanghai, but also within the
                    interview situations. &#8220;Emotions originate and develop in social
                    relations&#8221; and are &#8220;sustained by group processes&#8221; (<xref rid="IDdc69ee77-cc70-40c8-a86b-a118dfde6aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID719cdd01-67d2-4534-b94a-3eb8c02af60d">Mattley 2002, 365</xref>).
                    However, Mattley&#8217;s interactionist approach needs to be expanded to include
                    how emotions are experienced bodily. The anthropology of emotion addresses
                    feelings from different angles. John Leavitt (<xref rid="ID887e2ee5-9fa3-4490-9b4a-cd1287a88b81" ref-type="bibr" id="IDea96572a-4041-43fa-979f-597a52bbc7bc">1996</xref>) summarizes the
                    discourse as a great divide between positions that explain emotions as being
                    both bodily and universal, and those that argue for interpreting emotions as
                    cultural categories that are used to communicate sociocultural messages.
                    Consequently, Leavitt argues that emotions should be understood as both&#8212;as
                    acts of communication and bodily experiences&#8212;and calls for
                    conceptualizations and representations of emotions in ethnographic work that
                    overcome this meaning/feeling divide. By treating students&#8217;
                    re-interpretations of past emotions during the interviews as cognitive and
                    communicative processes, I understand that the emotional events described are
                    also felt bodily, sometimes even to a physically challenging degree. </p>
                <p>The physical, cognitive, and communicative aspects of emotions that might arise
                    due to international relocation become evident during all my group discussions
                    and interviews. Eleven-year-old Allen from the USA, reflecting upon his last
                    move to Mexico, uses the narrative of &#8220;culture shock&#8221; to explain
                    this experience to his fellow students and myself. Sitting in his school&#8217;s
                    art room, he summarizes the implications of moving and the overwhelming emotions
                    it brings along, telling me that he &#8220;pretty much got sick.&#8221;
                    Likewise, Britta, the seventeen-year-old girl from Norway who just arrived in
                    Shanghai a few months before the interview, vividly remembers how strange
                    Shanghai felt to her:</p>

                        <p>Yeah, we were sitting. I just had such a sad image: we came, we were
                            really jetlagged. We come to the hotel, it smells weird, we get this
                            weird food, it is supposed to be toast and jam and they can&#8217;t even
                            make toast and jam. We were just like really depressed. We look out the
                            window. It is raining; we can&#8217;t even see the street. It is a cloud
                            blocking our window. It was just like, I&#8217;m gonna live here.</p>

                        <p>And after some days, it was like, clearing of the weather and it
                            wasn&#8217;t that bad and depressing. We saw nice apartments and
                            everything, so &lt;L&gt; we are like, okay.</p>
                    </speech>
                </p>
                <p>Britta describes her discomfort upon arrival as not being able to see, and
                    instead smelling and tasting the new environment. She relates emotions like
                    &#8220;feeling depressed&#8221; to the new sensory experiences, the
                    unfamiliarity and seeming unmanageability of the city. Other students, like
                    seventeen-year-old Karina, also comment on how lonely they felt in the beginning
                    or still feel when getting homesick. During an interview, the German-Czech
                    teenager shares:</p>
                <p>
                    <speech id="s15">
                        <speaker>Karina</speaker>
                        <p><italic>And with the move. I don&#8217;t know. My mom feels terrible,
                            in the beginning felt terribly guilty for taking me away from Prague,
                            from all my friends. And I told her that it didn&#8217;t really bother
                            me that much. That&#8217;s what I thought at least in the beginning,
                            because we had moved so many times and I got used to it. I thought,
                            okay, I will find new friends here, and I will keep in touch with the
                            old ones. But now that I am here I think: &#8220;Crap! I am so far
                            away.&#8221; And in the first months I couldn&#8217;t stay in touch,
                            because Facebook didn&#8217;t work, nothing. I don&#8217;t know. I was
                            so alone here. [&#8230;] On the other hand, you get used to it. I got
                            pretty flexible. But still, this void when you are gone. You don&#8217;t
                            have anyone here. Though you know what to expect, but still, you really
                            can&#8217;t handle it in the beginning.</italic>

                    Karina&#8217;s narrative shows that even having moved internationally before
                    does not protect you from the inherent emotional turmoil of moving again. The
                    new place and the distance from friends &#8220;unsettle[s] agents with a
                    putatively global reach&#8221; (<xref rid="IDdc69ee77-cc70-40c8-a86b-a118dfde6aa6" ref-type="bibr" id="ID3ba84599-c77f-46b2-adca-b017b24d9fa2">ibid.</xref>). Karina also
                    shares how the moving experience strained her relationship with her mother.
                    Moreover, her story addresses how the lack of connections to her friends made it
                    difficult to cope with the emotional stress arising from the move.</p>
                <p>Karina&#8217;s classmate Bjorn, whose move from the German countryside to
                    Shanghai I discussed in Part I, Chapter 4 of this ethnography, likewise recalls
                    missing Germany and his friends in the beginning. However, one and a half years
                    after his move, he remembers his strategy in coping with these difficulties as
                    one of limiting his contact with his old friends.</p>
                <p>

                        <p>The first months were difficult with Germany. Even if it sounds pathetic,
                            the only way to get through that is to maintain as little contact as
                            possible. The best is to not even use Facebook, but instead to write an
                            email every few weeks; they reply again in a week. Then you also have
                            something to talk about again. But you aren&#8217;t so much involved.
                            Because if you chat, time and again you kind of think that you were part
                            of it and then it reminds you of the old days and that&#8217;s really

                <p>Bjorn&#8217;s retrospective on his first weeks in Shanghai shows how complex and
                    contradictory missing your friends and loneliness upon arrival can be. He sought
                    help by listening to others in Shanghai share their experiences, and eventually
                    trusted that his friendships in Germany could endure the distance.</p>
                <p>In summary, the expatriate youths discussed here often feel powerless about their
                    parents&#8217; decision to move to China. Simultaneously, they have to deal with the
                liminality of their stay and the likelihood of a new move. &#8220;Culture
                    shock,&#8221; the lack of friends and family, and problems within the family that
                may be reenforced by the move, as well as an unfamiliar urban environment and new
                sensory experiences, all pose emotional challenges to them. Part III,
                    &#8220;Arriving,&#8221; explores the expatriate students&#8217; strategies and ways
                of managing these experiences and emotions of powerlessness, loneliness, and
                unfamiliarity upon their arrival in Shanghai. </p>
